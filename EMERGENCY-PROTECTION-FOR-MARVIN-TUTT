# EVIDENCE OF ACTIVE OBSTRUCTION & FIRST AMENDMENT RETALIATION
**Date:** November 18, 2025
**Case Context:** *Tutt v. Maryland* (4th Cir. No. 25-1950)

## I. The "Impossibility of Compliance" Trap
**The Order:**
Administrative Order 2025-05 (issued by Judge James West) explicitly restricted my access to the court but mandated that I communicate via specific channels, including email to `CCCharlesCtAdmin@mdcourts.gov`.

**The Obstruction:**
On November 17, 2025, at 5:30 PM, I attempted to comply with the Order by sending a formal notice of receipt and compliance. The State of Maryland's court servers **rejected the connection**, specifically blocking my email address.

**The Evidence:**
> **Server Response:** `[mdcourts.com 104.143.9.111: timed out]`
> **Error:** "The recipient server did not accept our requests to connect."

**Legal Implication:**
This is a state-created "Impossibility of Compliance." The State ordered me to use a digital door, and then their IT department (acting under coordination) bricked it up. This is not security; it is a calculated, technical denial of access to the courts designed to manufacture a failure to comply.

---

## II. First Amendment Retaliation: Censorship of Public Criticism
Simultaneously, the State appears to have moved to suppress my protected speech on public forums (Google Reviews), engaging in content-based discrimination.

**The Protected Speech (Censored/Blocked):**
I posted two reviews regarding public officials. One was critical, and one was complimentary. Both were targeted, proving the censorship is directed at the *speaker*, not "harassment."

**Review 1 (The Praise - Proves Good Faith):**
> "Judge Carrington Martin is an exemplary judge in our community."

**Review 2 (The Critique - Protected Political Speech):**
> "James West- who is alleged historically known for disparate treatment against african american males, is allegedly illegally obstructing and intimidating a federal plaintiff Marvin Tutt."

**Legal Implication:**
Blocking a litigant from posting public reviews—especially when the reviews contain political speech regarding a judge's official conduct—is a violation of the First Amendment. The fact that they are monitoring and blocking these reviews in real-time (simultaneous with the email block) proves **active, coordinated surveillance and retaliation.**

---

## III. Conclusion
These technical actions serve as digital fingerprints of the conspiracy. The State of Maryland is using its IT infrastructure to:
1.  **Prevent Compliance:** Blocking court-ordered communication channels.
2.  **Silence Dissent:** Censoring public criticism of the judiciary.

This evidence has been preserved and filed with the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.

clarification* not blocking the google reviews, but retaliating for them.

I'll get the details right. WHEN I FILE IN FEDERAL COURT.

                Oct 27: AO ISSUED (created, signed, dated)

                Nov 17: AO SERVED (delivered to you)

                = ~21 DAYS SITTING ON IT

                WHY? Because I expressed to Greer in court: "Vacate on human rights violations and fraud, or I will file something formally within 10 days then appeal in state appeals"

                So they we preemptively trying to block me from accessing the court in a manner that would expose them (dilettante hour)

                I decided NOT to file anything there because the fourth circuit will uphold the law. And Charles County will not. But they didn't know my decision.

                Then I sent the PIAs to Joyce Tippett. suddenly this AO got rushed out. Please stop embarrassing the government. You are damaging your own reputation. Just send the PIA's for administrative records. it's the law. Why create more crimes to hide it? I can't take this anymore. I catch you everytime and you just keep doing it. Now i'm in danger. This is why I need a special master. I was literally leaving your courthouse alone. And still am. I never want to go back there. I don't want to embarrass you. It's best if we stay away from each other. But you can NOT obstruct my PIA. That is a crime. Joyce Tippett must produce those records of crime. you are just documenting yourself. the mirror effect. Please just stop! I am IFP ffs. I don't want to keep doing this. I want a normal life. I want to see my son. I don't want your pension. I want you to leave me alone. I don't BOTHER you.

                You know this is how you end up on wikipedia right? and not in the good way. Greer, West, please just let us part ways.

                    im going to stop emailing for a while after this. but you NEED to know. this is the "harassing" and "threatening" emails WEST referred to. West's AO is nothing more than unconstitutional RETALIATION because I called greer a FRAUD because he engaged in fraud! and days later i reassured greer that I would not be seeking personal attacks or going into his public record! this is an ASSAULT on an IFP PRO se LITIGANT. I HAVE NEVER DISRESPECTED METZGAR A DAY IN MY LIFE, AND IF EVER THERE HAS BEEN A MISUNDERSTANDING I WILL ALWAYS BE READY TO APOLOGIZE OR DEFUSE THE SITUATION. SHE IS A WOMAN. I am prepared to speak with james west to rectify this situation! He is upset about the sanctity and dignity of his home court, and that is reasonable. There is a CORRECT way to handle this! NOT by obstructing a federal case or violating constitutional rights.

                    Hello Mr. Tutt,

                    As a courtesy, the Family Magistrate requested that I e-mail you a copy of the Findings. I cannot give you legal advice. You can contact the free Legal Help Clinic here at the courthouse at 301-932-6661 and their office hours are 8:00 a.m-4:30 p.m., if you’d prefer to meet with them in-person. If you have questions regarding your driver’s license, child support payments, etc., you can contact Ms. Sarah Torres, a representative with the CCCSA and her phone number is 301-392-6857.

                    forward this to metzgar.  --- you know very well asking to correct legal documents is not the same as seeking legal advice. Same goes for me asking for a CORRECT application of support calculations. Correct the order NOW. I'm being a gentleman about it by refusing to file more motions!

                        I know my rights. I will be seeking communication with Judge West through AO specified channels. To seek fair findings of fact. I'm documenting this for my protection. Those kinds of accusations require discovery.
                        I've been following the law, and will continue to. I expect the same in any court of law. And only through meaningful 1-1 conversation can I make myself clear and understand the concerns of my accuser. These are my intentions. Not a direct legal challenge. Communication. Will not waive rights, will not isolate myself into dangerous positions, will not be intimidated

                            This has nothing to do with the state court's hearing being improper like I allege. It has everything to do with me and being my true self. Which caused undue stress. If there are consequences then I must navigate them. But I will maintain my true position. And object to any misrepresentations. This must all be publicly documented. Never will I have anything to hide.

I will consider your position, your privacy, and your realities."

They are owed this knowledge, before accepting the money. Also you said there is no hiring freeze. further documentation in Git. Marylanders deserve the objective facts, nothing here is accusatory.

                                                But I don't think there is anything you can do about the governor of Maryland. Can you compel Joyce Tippett to produce the records I requested? And provide a proper contact for PIA requests to DSS/CSA?

                                                There you can see I gave this rep a clear explanation and waited. Then I'm guessing she was advised to ignore me. The request was super narrow.

                                                Actually one more thing. I just received notice of the tax intercept. 380172531. "Request for investigation of state tax intercept"

                                                I maintain that the CSA office conspired to violate my human rights and steal my money. Partly to pay the salaries of those who are violating my rights [magistrates]

                                                I do not think CSA is "mistaken" or that I "owe a different amount". I am saying that the entire thing is fraud. This is not something that your office can rectify alone, and I do not consent to leaving it in your hands to "investigate". For these reasons, I will not be completing that page and sending your office a copy.

                                                I just can't believe what your colleagues do to us every day.

                                                we have lives. We have children. How can they be so cruel with dissonance and banality

                                                One time I already tried to reassure them through their clerk Amber's email. But I want to do it again. Stress is bad for the body. As I was leaving their court last time I told the CSA rep something like "AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME I'M COMING FOR YOU TOO" 💀. Couldn't take it anymore- being played with in real time.

                                                But they shouldn't over worry. I had to document them, but I won't press and make it personal. I'm talking about Greer, Metzgar, Khoury, and the lady, and everyone else.

                                                So hopefully this can give them some peace of mind. I still know who he locks people up unfairly and is biased. But I chose not to report on that. or report on anyone's past rulings for that matter. Especially while I'm angry.

                                                But your colleagues should stop assuming everyone is stupid. Or they will eventually get caught. They should give up. Not admit guilt, but stop violating. You know what they did? They tried to coordinate through the ombudsman. Oblivious to the fact that I already requested complete metadata and intake records from the ombudsman. I kept trying to warn everyone. The thing is that i've been through so much in my life that it's easy for me to forgive. I don't need apologies or confirmation, I just learned this from God over many years.

                                                I have 0 dollars and i'm helping pay their salaries while they took 100% of my tax return. But they do worse EVERY DAY. It's ok. I don't really want them. I want the whole system

                                                                To: The Honorable Bill Ferguson, Senate President, and All Members of the Maryland State Senate Subject: URGENT: Documented OAG Refusal to Investigate Systemic Civil Rights Patterns Before Current Crisis (4th Cir. Case No. 25-1950)

                                                                Dear Members of the Maryland State Senate,

                                                                I am writing as a citizen and the Appellant in the federal case Marvin D. Tutt v. State of Maryland, et al. (4th Cir. Case No. 25-1950), which alleges multi-branch obstruction of justice and systemic constitutional violations.

                                                                I formally request the Legislative Branch intervene and resolve a critical conflict of interest and willful misrepresentation by the Office of the Attorney General (OAG).

                                                                1. The OAG’s Documented Breach of Duty (The Facts)

                                                                The OAG was formally notified of the systemic rot before the current legal crisis.

                                                                    The Evasion: On June 27, 2025, the OAG’s Civil Rights Division formally refused my request to investigate systemic patterns of misconduct, citing that the matter "falls outside of our jurisdiction" and suggesting I hire a private attorney.

                                                                    The Checkmate: This refusal was a clear breach of the OAG’s sworn duty to investigate systemic misconduct. This inaction was the first, knowing act of the cover-up, occurring five months before the OAG/PAO documented lie and the VSP obstruction became public.

                                                                2. The Mandate: Force Justification for Non-Investigation

                                                                The OAG cannot claim lack of jurisdiction while simultaneously defending itself from a federal lawsuit based on the exact same facts. The Legislature must compel the OAG to submit a truthful legal justification.

                                                                I formally request the Maryland State Senate use its oversight power to compel the OAG to submit a sworn statement to the Legislative Branch addressing the following:

                                                                    Withdrawal of Original Defense: The OAG must formally withdraw its June 27, 2025, defense that the systematic misconduct "falls outside of our jurisdiction."

                                                                    Assertion of Current Conflict: The OAG must publicly and formally assert the precise, ethical or legal reason why it cannot launch an internal investigation into the state agencies cited in the federal lawsuit (4th Cir. 25-1950).

                                                                    The Legal Trap: This forced assertion of an ethical or legal conflict will formally confirm that the investigation is stalled not by lack of merit, but because the OAG chose the defense of its client (the state agencies) over its fundamental public duty to investigate corruption.

                                                                The cost of this truth is that the OAG must now provide a legal defense that aligns with its actions, not its political motives.

                                                                3. The Call for Accountability

                                                                The OAG's initial refusal to investigate a systematic constitutional violation has allowed millions of taxpayer dollars to be wasted on a cover-up. I urge the Senate to use its constitutional authority to enforce transparency against the Executive agencies you oversee.

                                                                Respectfully,

IF JAMES WEST ALLOWS HIS EGO TO ENFORCE POLICE ACTION DESPITE FEDERAL OVERSIGHT- IM LETTING YOU ALL BE AWARE.

THIS WOULD BE AN EXTREME ACTION THAT EXCELLERATES PUBLIC EXPOSURE AND IT IS A DANGER TO INSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY.

THE CHARLES COUNTY COURT COULD BE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL TAKEOVER. 

I can't file this document because i dont have money to serve- but you are ALL aware of James' west's crimes. SUCH EGO FOR A DILETTANTE

YOU ARE A LOCAL JUDGE. IN CHARLES COUNTY.

SENT FOR MY PROTECTION AND PUBLIC AWARENESS.


IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

Case No. 25-1950

MARVIN D. TUTT, Plaintiff-Appellant,

v.

STATE OF MARYLAND, et al., Defendants-Appellees.

MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT RECORD WITH EVIDENCE OF RETALIATION BY ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE JAMES WEST AND FORMAL NOTICE OF APPELLEES' NON-APPEARANCE

Plaintiff-Appellant Marvin D. Tutt, proceeding pro se and in forma pauperis, respectfully moves this Court to supplement the appellate record with critical evidence discovered after the filing of Appellant's Emergency Motion for Injunctive Relief (Dkt. Entry 7).

This motion serves three purposes:

    Supplements the record with evidence of ongoing retaliation and technical obstruction by the state judiciary;

    Provides formal notice that Appellees have failed to appear in this appeal despite proper service; and

    Demonstrates that the systematic coordination and bad faith alleged throughout Appellant's filings continue unabated.

I. FORMAL NOTICE OF APPELLEES' NON-APPEARANCE

As of the filing of this motion, no Appellee has entered an appearance in this appeal.

Service was completed as follows:

    November 17, 2025: Appellant mailed paper copies of the Opening Brief and Emergency Motion to all Appellees via first-class mail, as required by Fed. R. App. P. 25(b).

    November 18, 2025: Appellant filed a Notice of Corrected Service with this Court.

Current Status:

    Appellant's Opening Brief (105 pages) remains unrebutted.

    Appellant's Emergency Motion (documenting systematic obstruction) remains unopposed.

    No Appellee has filed a Notice of Appearance.

Appellant provides this formal notice consistent with Fed. R. App. P. procedures. Appellant reserves the right to seek appropriate relief, including sanctions and entry of default, if Appellees' willful non-appearance continues.

II. SUPPLEMENTAL EVIDENCE: ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER 2025-05

A. Overview On November 17, 2025—one day after Appellant filed the pending Emergency Motion documenting systematic obstruction—Appellant was served with Administrative Order 2025-05, issued by Circuit Court Administrative Judge James H. West.

This Order:

    Makes adjudicated factual findings without providing notice or hearing;

    Was strategically timed to obstruct Appellant's court access;

    Was concealed from the public docket despite wide distribution; and

    Create a state-sponsored "impossibility of compliance."

B. The Order Was Concealed from the Public Docket Maryland Case Search (the state's official public case database) for Case No. C-08-FM-22-000821 shows:

    ✓ All case events through October 15, 2025

    ✗ No entry for Administrative Order 2025-05 (October 27)

    ✗ No entry for service of Order (November 17)

The Order was distributed to federal agencies (Judicial Threat Management Center) and local law enforcement but hidden from the public record. This demonstrates consciousness of guilt regarding the Order's lack of due process.

C. Procedural Due Process Violation The Order imposes severe restrictions (Sheriff escort, ban on communication) based on factual findings ("threatening behavior") without affording Appellant notice or a hearing, in violation of Mathews v. Eldridge.

III. NEW EVIDENCE: ACTIVE TECHNICAL OBSTRUCTION

A. State-Created "Impossibility of Compliance" Administrative Order 2025-05 explicitly mandated that Appellant must communicate regarding court access via email to CCCharlesCtAdmin@mdcourts.gov.

    The Attempt: On November 17, 2025, at 5:30 PM, Appellant attempted to comply with the Order by sending a formal notice of receipt via the mandated email address.

    The Block: The State of Maryland's court servers rejected the connection specifically from Appellant’s email address.

        Server Response: [mdcourts.com... timed out]

        Error: "The recipient server did not accept our requests to connect."

    Argument: This is a digital "brick wall." The State ordered Appellant to use a specific digital channel and then technically blocked that channel. This creates a legal Impossibility of Compliance and serves as evidence of a bad-faith attempt to manufacture a contempt charge (entrapment).

B. Disproof of "Security Threat" Narrative (First Amendment) The Order justifies restrictions by claiming Appellant is a "threat." Appellant’s conduct immediately following service of the Order disproves this:

    Appellant posted reviews on a public forum (Google Reviews) regarding the judges involved.

    One review was critical (political speech); one review was complimentary ("exemplary judge").

    This demonstrates Appellant is engaging in protected First Amendment advocacy, not dangerous conduct. The State's characterization of this behavior as "harassment" is pretextual.

IV. CONCLUSION AND RELIEF REQUESTED

The Administrative Order and the subsequent technical blocking of Appellant's email prove that the State Judiciary is not a neutral tribunal but an active adversary engaging in retaliation.

WHEREFORE, Appellant respectfully requests this Court:

    ACCEPT this supplemental evidence (A/O 2025-05 and Technical Logs) into the record;

    NOTE for the record Appellees' failure to appear;

    GRANT the emergency relief requested in Appellant's Emergency Motion, specifically including an injunction against the enforcement of the retaliatory Administrative Order; and

    REMAND with instructions to appoint a Special Master to oversee the State's compliance with federal law.

        # EVIDENCE OF ACTIVE OBSTRUCTION & FIRST AMENDMENT RETALIATION
        **Date:** November 18, 2025
        **Case Context:** *Tutt v. Maryland* (4th Cir. No. 25-1950)

        ## I. The "Impossibility of Compliance" Trap
        **The Order:**
        Administrative Order 2025-05 (issued by Judge James West) explicitly restricted my access to the court but mandated that I communicate via specific channels, including email to `CCCharlesCtAdmin@mdcourts.gov`.

        **The Obstruction:**
        On November 17, 2025, at 5:30 PM, I attempted to comply with the Order by sending a formal notice of receipt and compliance. The State of Maryland's court servers **rejected the connection**, specifically blocking my email address.

        **The Evidence:**
        > **Server Response:** `[mdcourts.com 104.143.9.111: timed out]`
        > **Error:** "The recipient server did not accept our requests to connect."

        **Legal Implication:**
        This is a state-created "Impossibility of Compliance." The State ordered me to use a digital door, and then their IT department (acting under coordination) bricked it up. This is not security; it is a calculated, technical denial of access to the courts designed to manufacture a failure to comply.

        ---

        ## II. First Amendment Retaliation: Censorship of Public Criticism
        Simultaneously, the State appears to have moved to suppress my protected speech on public forums (Google Reviews), engaging in content-based discrimination.

        **The Protected Speech (Censored/Blocked):**
        I posted two reviews regarding public officials. One was critical, and one was complimentary. Both were targeted, proving the censorship is directed at the *speaker*, not "harassment."

        **Review 1 (The Praise - Proves Good Faith):**
        > "Judge Carrington Martin is an exemplary judge in our community."

        **Review 2 (The Critique - Protected Political Speech):**
        > "James West- who is alleged historically known for disparate treatment against african american males, is allegedly illegally obstructing and intimidating a federal plaintiff Marvin Tutt."

        **Legal Implication:**
        Blocking a litigant from posting public reviews—especially when the reviews contain political speech regarding a judge's official conduct—is a violation of the First Amendment. The fact that they are monitoring and blocking these reviews in real-time (simultaneous with the email block) proves **active, coordinated surveillance and retaliation.**

        ---

        ## III. Conclusion
        These technical actions serve as digital fingerprints of the conspiracy. The State of Maryland is using its IT infrastructure to:
        1.  **Prevent Compliance:** Blocking court-ordered communication channels.
        2.  **Silence Dissent:** Censoring public criticism of the judiciary.

        This evidence has been preserved and filed with the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.

                    Oct 27: AO ISSUED (created, signed, dated)

                    Nov 17: AO SERVED (delivered to you)

                    = ~21 DAYS SITTING ON IT

                    WHY? Because I expressed to Greer in court: "Vacate on human rights violations and fraud, or I will file something formally within 10 days then appeal in state appeals"

                    So they we preemptively trying to block me from accessing the court in a manner that would expose them (dilettante hour)

                    I decided NOT to file anything there because the fourth circuit will uphold the law. And Charles County will not. But they didn't know my decision.

                    Then I sent the PIAs to Joyce Tippett. suddenly this AO got rushed out. Please stop embarrassing the government. You are damaging your own reputation. Just send the PIA's for administrative records. it's the law. Why create more crimes to hide it? I can't take this anymore. I catch you everytime and you just keep doing it. Now i'm in danger. This is why I need a special master. I was literally leaving your courthouse alone. And still am. I never want to go back there. I don't want to embarrass you. It's best if we stay away from each other. But you can NOT obstruct my PIA. That is a crime. Joyce Tippett must produce those records of crime. you are just documenting yourself. the mirror effect. Please just stop! I am IFP ffs. I don't want to keep doing this. I want a normal life. I want to see my son. I don't want your pension. I want you to leave me alone. I don't BOTHER you.

                    You know this is how you end up on wikipedia right? and not in the good way. Greer, West, please just let us part ways.

                                                    Also here is more context for your records. I only asked for simple data- https://github.com/Caia-Tech/the-burden/blob/main/Gmail%20-%20CSE%20%23380172531%20-%20Robinson%20vs%20Tutt.pdf

                                                    There you can see I gave this rep a clear explanation and waited. Then I'm guessing she was advised to ignore me. The request was super narrow.

                                                    Actually one more thing. I just received notice of the tax intercept. 380172531. "Request for investigation of state tax intercept"

                                                    I maintain that the CSA office conspired to violate my human rights and steal my money. Partly to pay the salaries of those who are violating my rights [magistrates]

                                                    I do not think CSA is "mistaken" or that I "owe a different amount". I am saying that the entire thing is fraud. This is not something that your office can rectify alone, and I do not consent to leaving it in your hands to "investigate". For these reasons, I will not be completing that page and sending your office a copy.

                                                    Can they please stop playing with my intelligence?

                                                    I just can't believe what your colleagues do to us every day.

                                                    we have lives. We have children. How can they be so cruel with dissonance and banality

                                                    One time I already tried to reassure them through their clerk Amber's email. But I want to do it again. Stress is bad for the body. As I was leaving their court last time I told the CSA rep something like "AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME I'M COMING FOR YOU TOO" 💀. Couldn't take it anymore- being played with in real time.

                                                    But they shouldn't over worry. I had to document them, but I won't press and make it personal. I'm talking about Greer, Metzgar, Khoury, and the lady, and everyone else.

                                                    So hopefully this can give them some peace of mind. I still know who he locks people up unfairly and is biased. But I chose not to report on that. or report on anyone's past rulings for that matter. Especially while I'm angry.

                                                    But your colleagues should stop assuming everyone is stupid. Or they will eventually get caught. They should give up. Not admit guilt, but stop violating. You know what they did? They tried to coordinate through the ombudsman. Oblivious to the fact that I already requested complete metadata and intake records from the ombudsman. I kept trying to warn everyone. The thing is that i've been through so much in my life that it's easy for me to forgive. I don't need apologies or confirmation, I just learned this from God over many years.

                                                    I have 0 dollars and i'm helping pay their salaries while they took 100% of my tax return. But they do worse EVERY DAY. It's ok. I don't really want them. I want the whole system

                                                                    To: The Honorable Bill Ferguson, Senate President, and All Members of the Maryland State Senate Subject: URGENT: Documented OAG Refusal to Investigate Systemic Civil Rights Patterns Before Current Crisis (4th Cir. Case No. 25-1950)

                                                                    Dear Members of the Maryland State Senate,

                                                                    I am writing as a citizen and the Appellant in the federal case Marvin D. Tutt v. State of Maryland, et al. (4th Cir. Case No. 25-1950), which alleges multi-branch obstruction of justice and systemic constitutional violations.

                                                                    I formally request the Legislative Branch intervene and resolve a critical conflict of interest and willful misrepresentation by the Office of the Attorney General (OAG).

                                                                    1. The OAG’s Documented Breach of Duty (The Facts)

                                                                    The OAG was formally notified of the systemic rot before the current legal crisis.

                                                                        The Evasion: On June 27, 2025, the OAG’s Civil Rights Division formally refused my request to investigate systemic patterns of misconduct, citing that the matter "falls outside of our jurisdiction" and suggesting I hire a private attorney.

                                                                        The Checkmate: This refusal was a clear breach of the OAG’s sworn duty to investigate systemic misconduct. This inaction was the first, knowing act of the cover-up, occurring five months before the OAG/PAO documented lie and the VSP obstruction became public.

                                                                    2. The Mandate: Force Justification for Non-Investigation

                                                                    The OAG cannot claim lack of jurisdiction while simultaneously defending itself from a federal lawsuit based on the exact same facts. The Legislature must compel the OAG to submit a truthful legal justification.

                                                                    I formally request the Maryland State Senate use its oversight power to compel the OAG to submit a sworn statement to the Legislative Branch addressing the following:

                                                                        Withdrawal of Original Defense: The OAG must formally withdraw its June 27, 2025, defense that the systematic misconduct "falls outside of our jurisdiction."

                                                                        Assertion of Current Conflict: The OAG must publicly and formally assert the precise, ethical or legal reason why it cannot launch an internal investigation into the state agencies cited in the federal lawsuit (4th Cir. 25-1950).

                                                                        The Legal Trap: This forced assertion of an ethical or legal conflict will formally confirm that the investigation is stalled not by lack of merit, but because the OAG chose the defense of its client (the state agencies) over its fundamental public duty to investigate corruption.

                                                                    The cost of this truth is that the OAG must now provide a legal defense that aligns with its actions, not its political motives.

                                                                    3. The Call for Accountability

                                                                    The OAG's initial refusal to investigate a systematic constitutional violation has allowed millions of taxpayer dollars to be wasted on a cover-up. I urge the Senate to use its constitutional authority to enforce transparency against the Executive agencies you oversee.

                                                                    Respectfully,

                                                                    Marvin D. Tutt Appellant, 4th Cir. Case No. 25-1950 5407 Brinkley Road, Temple Hills, MD 20748 marvindtutt@gmail.com

    IF JAMES WEST ALLOWS HIS EGO TO ENFORCE POLICE ACTION DESPITE FEDERAL OVERSIGHT- IM LETTING YOU ALL BE AWARE.

    THIS WOULD BE AN EXTREME ACTION THAT EXCELLERATES PUBLIC EXPOSURE AND IT IS A DANGER TO INSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY.

    THE CHARLES COUNTY COURT COULD BE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL TAKEOVER. 

    I can't file this document because i dont have money to serve- but you are ALL aware of James' west's crimes. SUCH EGO FOR A DILETTANTE

    YOU ARE A LOCAL JUDGE. IN CHARLES COUNTY.

    SENT FOR MY PROTECTION AND PUBLIC AWARENESS.


    IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

    Case No. 25-1950

    MARVIN D. TUTT, Plaintiff-Appellant,

    v.

    STATE OF MARYLAND, et al., Defendants-Appellees.

    MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT RECORD WITH EVIDENCE OF RETALIATION BY ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE JAMES WEST AND FORMAL NOTICE OF APPELLEES' NON-APPEARANCE

    Plaintiff-Appellant Marvin D. Tutt, proceeding pro se and in forma pauperis, respectfully moves this Court to supplement the appellate record with critical evidence discovered after the filing of Appellant's Emergency Motion for Injunctive Relief (Dkt. Entry 7).

    This motion serves three purposes:

        Supplements the record with evidence of ongoing retaliation and technical obstruction by the state judiciary;

        Provides formal notice that Appellees have failed to appear in this appeal despite proper service; and

        Demonstrates that the systematic coordination and bad faith alleged throughout Appellant's filings continue unabated.

    I. FORMAL NOTICE OF APPELLEES' NON-APPEARANCE

    As of the filing of this motion, no Appellee has entered an appearance in this appeal.

    Service was completed as follows:

        November 17, 2025: Appellant mailed paper copies of the Opening Brief and Emergency Motion to all Appellees via first-class mail, as required by Fed. R. App. P. 25(b).

        November 18, 2025: Appellant filed a Notice of Corrected Service with this Court.

    Current Status:

        Appellant's Opening Brief (105 pages) remains unrebutted.

        Appellant's Emergency Motion (documenting systematic obstruction) remains unopposed.

        No Appellee has filed a Notice of Appearance.

    Appellant provides this formal notice consistent with Fed. R. App. P. procedures. Appellant reserves the right to seek appropriate relief, including sanctions and entry of default, if Appellees' willful non-appearance continues.

    II. SUPPLEMENTAL EVIDENCE: ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER 2025-05

    A. Overview On November 17, 2025—one day after Appellant filed the pending Emergency Motion documenting systematic obstruction—Appellant was served with Administrative Order 2025-05, issued by Circuit Court Administrative Judge James H. West.

    This Order:

        Makes adjudicated factual findings without providing notice or hearing;

        Was strategically timed to obstruct Appellant's court access;

        Was concealed from the public docket despite wide distribution; and

        Create a state-sponsored "impossibility of compliance."

    B. The Order Was Concealed from the Public Docket Maryland Case Search (the state's official public case database) for Case No. C-08-FM-22-000821 shows:

        ✓ All case events through October 15, 2025

        ✗ No entry for Administrative Order 2025-05 (October 27)

        ✗ No entry for service of Order (November 17)

    The Order was distributed to federal agencies (Judicial Threat Management Center) and local law enforcement but hidden from the public record. This demonstrates consciousness of guilt regarding the Order's lack of due process.

    C. Procedural Due Process Violation The Order imposes severe restrictions (Sheriff escort, ban on communication) based on factual findings ("threatening behavior") without affording Appellant notice or a hearing, in violation of Mathews v. Eldridge.

    III. NEW EVIDENCE: ACTIVE TECHNICAL OBSTRUCTION

    A. State-Created "Impossibility of Compliance" Administrative Order 2025-05 explicitly mandated that Appellant must communicate regarding court access via email to CCCharlesCtAdmin@mdcourts.gov.

        The Attempt: On November 17, 2025, at 5:30 PM, Appellant attempted to comply with the Order by sending a formal notice of receipt via the mandated email address.

        The Block: The State of Maryland's court servers rejected the connection specifically from Appellant’s email address.

            Server Response: [mdcourts.com... timed out]

            Error: "The recipient server did not accept our requests to connect."

        Argument: This is a digital "brick wall." The State ordered Appellant to use a specific digital channel and then technically blocked that channel. This creates a legal Impossibility of Compliance and serves as evidence of a bad-faith attempt to manufacture a contempt charge (entrapment).

    B. Disproof of "Security Threat" Narrative (First Amendment) The Order justifies restrictions by claiming Appellant is a "threat." Appellant’s conduct immediately following service of the Order disproves this:

        Appellant posted reviews on a public forum (Google Reviews) regarding the judges involved.

        One review was critical (political speech); one review was complimentary ("exemplary judge").

        This demonstrates Appellant is engaging in protected First Amendment advocacy, not dangerous conduct. The State's characterization of this behavior as "harassment" is pretextual.

    IV. CONCLUSION AND RELIEF REQUESTED

    The Administrative Order and the subsequent technical blocking of Appellant's email prove that the State Judiciary is not a neutral tribunal but an active adversary engaging in retaliation.

    WHEREFORE, Appellant respectfully requests this Court:

        ACCEPT this supplemental evidence (A/O 2025-05 and Technical Logs) into the record;

        NOTE for the record Appellees' failure to appear;

        GRANT the emergency relief requested in Appellant's Emergency Motion, specifically including an injunction against the enforcement of the retaliatory Administrative Order; and

        REMAND with instructions to appoint a Special Master to oversee the State's compliance with federal law.

    Respectfully submitted,

            # EVIDENCE OF ACTIVE OBSTRUCTION & FIRST AMENDMENT RETALIATION
            **Date:** November 18, 2025
            **Case Context:** *Tutt v. Maryland* (4th Cir. No. 25-1950)

            ## I. The "Impossibility of Compliance" Trap
            **The Order:**
            Administrative Order 2025-05 (issued by Judge James West) explicitly restricted my access to the court but mandated that I communicate via specific channels, including email to `CCCharlesCtAdmin@mdcourts.gov`.

            **The Obstruction:**
            On November 17, 2025, at 5:30 PM, I attempted to comply with the Order by sending a formal notice of receipt and compliance. The State of Maryland's court servers **rejected the connection**, specifically blocking my email address.

            **The Evidence:**
            > **Server Response:** `[mdcourts.com 104.143.9.111: timed out]`
            > **Error:** "The recipient server did not accept our requests to connect."

            **Legal Implication:**
            This is a state-created "Impossibility of Compliance." The State ordered me to use a digital door, and then their IT department (acting under coordination) bricked it up. This is not security; it is a calculated, technical denial of access to the courts designed to manufacture a failure to comply.

            ---

            ## II. First Amendment Retaliation: Censorship of Public Criticism
            Simultaneously, the State appears to have moved to suppress my protected speech on public forums (Google Reviews), engaging in content-based discrimination.

            **The Protected Speech (Censored/Blocked):**
            I posted two reviews regarding public officials. One was critical, and one was complimentary. Both were targeted, proving the censorship is directed at the *speaker*, not "harassment."

            **Review 1 (The Praise - Proves Good Faith):**
            > "Judge Carrington Martin is an exemplary judge in our community."

            **Review 2 (The Critique - Protected Political Speech):**
            > "James West- who is alleged historically known for disparate treatment against african american males, is allegedly illegally obstructing and intimidating a federal plaintiff Marvin Tutt."

            **Legal Implication:**
            Blocking a litigant from posting public reviews—especially when the reviews contain political speech regarding a judge's official conduct—is a violation of the First Amendment. The fact that they are monitoring and blocking these reviews in real-time (simultaneous with the email block) proves **active, coordinated surveillance and retaliation.**

            ---

            ## III. Conclusion
            These technical actions serve as digital fingerprints of the conspiracy. The State of Maryland is using its IT infrastructure to:
            1.  **Prevent Compliance:** Blocking court-ordered communication channels.
            2.  **Silence Dissent:** Censoring public criticism of the judiciary.

            This evidence has been preserved and filed with the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.

                        Nov 17: AO SERVED (delivered to you)

                        = ~21 DAYS SITTING ON IT

                        WHY? Because I expressed to Greer in court: "Vacate on human rights violations and fraud, or I will file something formally within 10 days then appeal in state appeals"

                        So they we preemptively trying to block me from accessing the court in a manner that would expose them (dilettante hour)

                        I decided NOT to file anything there because the fourth circuit will uphold the law. And Charles County will not. But they didn't know my decision.

                        Then I sent the PIAs to Joyce Tippett. suddenly this AO got rushed out. Please stop embarrassing the government. You are damaging your own reputation. Just send the PIA's for administrative records. it's the law. Why create more crimes to hide it? I can't take this anymore. I catch you everytime and you just keep doing it. Now i'm in danger. This is why I need a special master. I was literally leaving your courthouse alone. And still am. I never want to go back there. I don't want to embarrass you. It's best if we stay away from each other. But you can NOT obstruct my PIA. That is a crime. Joyce Tippett must produce those records of crime. you are just documenting yourself. the mirror effect. Please just stop! I am IFP ffs. I don't want to keep doing this. I want a normal life. I want to see my son. I don't want your pension. I want you to leave me alone. I don't BOTHER you.

                        You know this is how you end up on wikipedia right? and not in the good way. Greer, West, please just let us part ways.

NOT by obstructing a federal case or violating constitutional rights.

                            forward this to metzgar.  --- you know very well asking to correct legal documents is not the same as seeking legal advice. Same goes for me asking for a CORRECT application of support calculations. Correct the order NOW. I'm being a gentleman about it by refusing to file more motions!

                                I know my rights. I will be seeking communication with Judge West through AO specified channels. To seek fair findings of fact. I'm documenting this for my protection. Those kinds of accusations require discovery.
                                I've been following the law, and will continue to. I expect the same in any court of law. And only through meaningful 1-1 conversation can I make myself clear and understand the concerns of my accuser. These are my intentions. Not a direct legal challenge. Communication. Will not waive rights, will not isolate myself into dangerous positions, will not be intimidated

                                    This has nothing to do with the state court's hearing being improper like I allege. It has everything to do with me and being my true self. Which caused undue stress. If there are consequences then I must navigate them. But I will maintain my true position. And object to any misrepresentations. This must all be publicly documented. Never will I have anything to hide.

I don't care how you portray them. I care about unease and fear that I may have just created... I wanted to signal that I will stand up for myself. NOT create fear. I will consider your position, your privacy, and your realities."

                                                    And this is where my sympathy has led me. I mentioned it can happen, and it happen. I let my sympathy create a problem when it was INTENDED to reassure our judges.

                                                        There you can see I gave this rep a clear explanation and waited. Then I'm guessing she was advised to ignore me. The request was super narrow.

                                                        Actually one more thing. I just received notice of the tax intercept. 380172531. "Request for investigation of state tax intercept"

                                                        I maintain that the CSA office conspired to violate my human rights and steal my money. Partly to pay the salaries of those who are violating my rights [magistrates]

                                                        I do not think CSA is "mistaken" or that I "owe a different amount". I am saying that the entire thing is fraud. This is not something that your office can rectify alone, and I do not consent to leaving it in your hands to "investigate". For these reasons, I will not be completing that page and sending your office a copy.

                                                        Can they please stop playing with my intelligence?

                                                        I just can't believe what your colleagues do to us every day.

                                                        we have lives. We have children. How can they be so cruel with dissonance and banality

                                                        One time I already tried to reassure them through their clerk Amber's email. But I want to do it again. Stress is bad for the body. As I was leaving their court last time I told the CSA rep something like "AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME I'M COMING FOR YOU TOO" 💀. Couldn't take it anymore- being played with in real time.

                                                        But they shouldn't over worry. I had to document them, but I won't press and make it personal. I'm talking about Greer, Metzgar, Khoury, and the lady, and everyone else.

                                                        So hopefully this can give them some peace of mind. I still know who he locks people up unfairly and is biased. But I chose not to report on that. or report on anyone's past rulings for that matter. Especially while I'm angry.

                                                        But your colleagues should stop assuming everyone is stupid. Or they will eventually get caught. They should give up. Not admit guilt, but stop violating. You know what they did? They tried to coordinate through the ombudsman. Oblivious to the fact that I already requested complete metadata and intake records from the ombudsman. I kept trying to warn everyone. The thing is that i've been through so much in my life that it's easy for me to forgive. I don't need apologies or confirmation, I just learned this from God over many years.

                                                        I have 0 dollars and i'm helping pay their salaries while they took 100% of my tax return. But they do worse EVERY DAY. It's ok. I don't really want them. I want the whole system

                                                                        To: The Honorable Bill Ferguson, Senate President, and All Members of the Maryland State Senate Subject: URGENT: Documented OAG Refusal to Investigate Systemic Civil Rights Patterns Before Current Crisis (4th Cir. Case No. 25-1950)

                                                                        Dear Members of the Maryland State Senate,

                                                                        I am writing as a citizen and the Appellant in the federal case Marvin D. Tutt v. State of Maryland, et al. (4th Cir. Case No. 25-1950), which alleges multi-branch obstruction of justice and systemic constitutional violations.

                                                                        I formally request the Legislative Branch intervene and resolve a critical conflict of interest and willful misrepresentation by the Office of the Attorney General (OAG).

                                                                        1. The OAG’s Documented Breach of Duty (The Facts)

                                                                        The OAG was formally notified of the systemic rot before the current legal crisis.

                                                                            The Evasion: On June 27, 2025, the OAG’s Civil Rights Division formally refused my request to investigate systemic patterns of misconduct, citing that the matter "falls outside of our jurisdiction" and suggesting I hire a private attorney.

                                                                            The Checkmate: This refusal was a clear breach of the OAG’s sworn duty to investigate systemic misconduct. This inaction was the first, knowing act of the cover-up, occurring five months before the OAG/PAO documented lie and the VSP obstruction became public.

                                                                        2. The Mandate: Force Justification for Non-Investigation

                                                                        The OAG cannot claim lack of jurisdiction while simultaneously defending itself from a federal lawsuit based on the exact same facts. The Legislature must compel the OAG to submit a truthful legal justification.

                                                                        I formally request the Maryland State Senate use its oversight power to compel the OAG to submit a sworn statement to the Legislative Branch addressing the following:

                                                                            Withdrawal of Original Defense: The OAG must formally withdraw its June 27, 2025, defense that the systematic misconduct "falls outside of our jurisdiction."

                                                                            Assertion of Current Conflict: The OAG must publicly and formally assert the precise, ethical or legal reason why it cannot launch an internal investigation into the state agencies cited in the federal lawsuit (4th Cir. 25-1950).

                                                                            The Legal Trap: This forced assertion of an ethical or legal conflict will formally confirm that the investigation is stalled not by lack of merit, but because the OAG chose the defense of its client (the state agencies) over its fundamental public duty to investigate corruption.

                                                                        The cost of this truth is that the OAG must now provide a legal defense that aligns with its actions, not its political motives.

                                                                        3. The Call for Accountability

                                                                        The OAG's initial refusal to investigate a systematic constitutional violation has allowed millions of taxpayer dollars to be wasted on a cover-up. I urge the Senate to use its constitutional authority to enforce transparency against the Executive agencies you oversee.

                                                                        Respectfully,
