Other poems/verse/notes/continued, will post them here.

Play my part (poem)

You said we was partners, I took it to the heart
Now I'm sittin' patient, hope they don't pull my life apart
I kept it real from the jump, and I kept solid from the start
You know what I'm doin’, I gotta play my part

I hope the sheriff keep his distance, feds playin' wicked
Hope I don’t end up with another sentence
Came from the basement with crickets, Jehovah my witness
When I commit they listen, everybody pay attention

I wanted to be a physician, not a musician
I started off with ambition, then i lost my position
I can see clear from a distance, razor sharp intuition
I just want peace that's my mission, they think I'm coming for pensions
