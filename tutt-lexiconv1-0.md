# Tutt Lexicon v1.0

**“Dilettantes.”**  
“You’re cosplaying expertise.”  
→ Attacks their professional ego, not just their argument.

**“Explain that, bureaucrat.”**  
“Drop the script and defend this like a human.”  
→ Forces them out of canned language into raw accountability.

**“The court my alma mater.”**  
“You had law school. I had you.”  
→ Turns their credential flex into an indictment of their behavior.

**“You’re a fraud.”**  
“Your role is a lie, not just this ruling.”  
→ Reframes them from neutral arbiter to bad-faith actor.

**“Mathematical proof.”**  
“This isn’t a rant, it’s a derivation.”  
→ Puts your filings in the frame of logic, not “emotion.”
