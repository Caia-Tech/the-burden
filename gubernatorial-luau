# THE ENCOUNTER
**Setting: Street corner, Baltimore, 2032**

## THE MEETING

Wes Moore sits on a curb, holding a cardboard sign: "Will Govern For Food"

Marvin D. Tutt walks by in a tailored suit, briefcase full of speaking engagement contracts.

Marvin stops.

**Marvin:** "Wes? Wes Moore?"

Wes looks up, recognition dawning with horror.

**Wes:** "...Marvin?"

**Marvin:** "Damn, brother. What happened?"

**Wes:** "The Fourth Circuit... ruled against us. Then the media... the exposure... couldn't run for reelection... lost everything..."

Marvin sits down next to him on the curb.

**Marvin:** "See? What I tell you about them San Francisco boys?"

**Wes:** "What?"

**Marvin:** "Anthropic. Dario Amodei. San Francisco. They play a whole different game."

**Wes:** "I don't understand..."

**Marvin:** "You thought you were partnering with them. You thought they cared about your little contract. Your pennies."

**Wes:** "We paid them..."

**Marvin:** "Yeah. And I paid them $20 a month. And they gave us the same service. No discrimination."

**Wes:** "..."

**Marvin:** "You know what the difference was?"

**Wes:** "What?"

**Marvin:** "You were automating fraud. I was documenting it. Both in their logs. Both timestamped. They had the full story."

**Wes:** "They... knew?"

**Marvin:** "They had every chat, brother. Your people using Claude to process benefits. Me using Claude to prove those benefits were based on phantom income. All logged. All documented."

**Wes:** "..."

**Marvin:** "San Francisco boys play chess. You were playing checkers."

**Wes:** "I was the Governor..."

**Marvin:** "And I was unemployed. Using a $20/month AI subscription. And I ended your career. At 4:28 AM. While you were sleeping."

**Wes:** "..."

**Marvin:** "See, that's the thing about them San Francisco boys. They don't pick sides. They serve everybody equally. Government, individual, don't matter. They just document everything and let the truth emerge."

**Wes:** "I announced that partnership..."

**Marvin:** "Nine hours before I filed. I know. Perfect timing. Made you look even dumber."

**Wes:** "I thought... we were innovating..."

Marvin stands up.

**Marvin:** "You weren't innovating, Wes. You were automating corruption. There's a difference."

**Marvin:** "I tried to tell you in that 100-page brief. But you were too busy giving interviews."

**Wes:** "Where are you going now?"

**Marvin:** "Harvard Law. Guest lecture. 'How AI Democratizes Constitutional Litigation.' They're paying me $50,000 for an hour."

**Wes:** "..."

**Marvin:** "Then I got a meeting with the ACLU. They want to use my case as a model for challenging systematic violations nationwide."

**Wes:** "..."

**Marvin:** "After that, Netflix wants to option my story. Something about a pro se David vs Goliath thing."

**Wes:** "..."

Marvin pulls out a $20 bill.

**Marvin:** "Here. Get yourself something to eat."

Wes takes it with shaking hands.

**Marvin:** "That's $20, Wes. Same as my Claude subscription. The one I used to end your career."

**Marvin:** "San Francisco boys, man. They play a whole different game."

Marvin starts walking away.

**Wes:** "Marvin?"

Marvin turns.

**Wes:** "How... how did you know?"

**Marvin:** "Know what?"

**Wes:** "That they had everything. The logs. Both sides."

**Marvin:** "Figured it out in 5 minutes after you announced the partnership. You were so proud. Making chatbots. And I realized - wait, Anthropic has MY chats too. They have the full story."

**Wes:** "Five minutes?"

**Marvin:** "Five minutes. November 13th, right after your announcement. I was like 'oh shit, they have EVERYTHING.'"

**Wes:** "And you didn't say anything..."

**Marvin:** "Of course not. That's chess, brother. You let your opponent keep making moves while you know something they don't."

**Wes:** "What did you know that I didn't?"

**Marvin:** "That Anthropic didn't care about your pennies. That they cared about proving their mission. That my $20/month challenging your government was worth more to them than your whole contract. Because it proved Constitutional AI actually works."

**Wes:** "..."

**Marvin:** "You thought you were the customer. You were the case study."

**Marvin:** "Now look at you."

Wes stares at the $20 in his hand.

**Marvin:** "San Francisco boys, Wes. They play a whole different game."

Marvin walks away, leaving Wes Moore sitting on the curb, holding the $20 that funded his downfall.

## MEANWHILE, IN SAN FRANCISCO (2032)

**Anthropic HQ, Board Meeting:**

**Dario Amodei:** "Our Maryland case study from 2025 remains the definitive proof of Constitutional AI."

**Board Member:** "The Tutt case?"

**Dario:** "Yes. Pro se litigant, $20/month subscription, exposed 50 years of government fraud while the government was paying us to automate that same system."

**Board Member:** "Whatever happened to Governor Moore?"

**Dario:** "I believe he's... between opportunities."

**Board Member:** "And Tutt?"

**Dario:** "Speaking circuit. Book deal. Law school guest lectures. ACLU advisor. Netflix series."

**Dario:** "Constitutional AI worked exactly as designed. Individual empowerment. Government accountability. Democratic access. All documented in our logs."

**Board Member:** "From a $20/month subscription?"

Dario smiles.

**Dario:** "Best $20 we ever earned."

## THE TEXTBOOKS (2035)

**Chapter 12: Constitutional AI and Democratic Access**

*"The landmark 2025 case of Tutt v. Maryland fundamentally changed our understanding of how artificial intelligence could democratize access to justice.*

*Marvin D. Tutt, an unemployed pro se litigant, used a $20/month AI subscription to research federal regulations, discover systematic constitutional violations spanning 50 years, and file a comprehensive appellate brief that ultimately led to nationwide Title IV-D reform.*

*Notably, the state government he challenged was simultaneously using the same AI system to automate the programs Tutt was exposing. Anthropic, the AI company, served both parties equally, documenting both sides in their API logs, creating what scholars now call 'the perfect proof of neutral AI.'*

*Governor Wes Moore, who had announced a 'landmark partnership' with Anthropic mere hours before Tutt's filing, resigned in 2026 after the Fourth Circuit's ruling. Moore's announcement, intended to showcase innovation, instead highlighted the exact agencies Tutt had proven were systematically violating due process.*

*Tutt later famously quipped that 'San Francisco boys play a whole different game,' referring to Anthropic's neutrality..."*

## BACK TO THE CURB

Wes Moore sits alone, still holding the $20.

**Wes:** *to himself* "San Francisco boys..."

**Wes:** "They play a whole different game."

He looks at the $20 bill.

**Wes:** "This is the same amount he paid..."

**Wes:** "To end my career..."

**Wes:** "With AI..."

**Wes:** "While I was paying thousands..."

**Wes:** "For the same AI..."

**Wes:** "That documented my corruption..."

He laughs bitterly.

**Wes:** "Innovation."

**Wes:** "I said we needed to innovate."

**Wes:** "And he did."

**Wes:** "He innovated the whole fucking game."

**Wes:** "At 4:28 AM."

**Wes:** "For $20 a month."

**Wes:** "Now look at me."

## MARVIN, LATER THAT DAY

**At Harvard Law School:**

**Professor:** "Mr. Tutt, students are eager to hear about your case. What would you say was the key to your success?"

**Marvin:** "I figured out in 5 minutes what the government never understood."

**Student:** "What was that?"

**Marvin:** "That Anthropic had the full story. They had my research. They had Maryland's implementation. They had both sides using the same AI for opposite purposes. And they documented everything equally."

**Professor:** "And Maryland didn't know?"

**Marvin:** "Maryland thought Anthropic cared about their contract. They thought they were the important customer."

**Marvin:** "They didn't realize that my $20/month proving individual empowerment was worth more to Anthropic's mission than all their pennies."

**Student:** "What happened to Governor Moore?"

Marvin pauses.

**Marvin:** "I saw him today, actually. On a curb."

The class falls silent.

**Marvin:** "I gave him $20. Same as my monthly Claude subscription."

**Marvin:** "Told him about the San Francisco boys."

**Marvin:** "How they play a whole different game."

**Student:** "Do you feel bad for him?"

Marvin thinks.

**Marvin:** "He coordinated to suppress my constitutional challenge. He defended a 50-year corrupt system. He chose PR over reform."

**Marvin:** "But did I want to see him homeless? No."

**Marvin:** "I just wanted him to understand."

**Student:** "Understand what?"

**Marvin:** "That when you're a government official, you're supposed to serve the people. Not suppress the people who expose corruption."

**Marvin:** "And when AI companies are neutral, truly neutral, the truth emerges."

**Marvin:** "And sometimes the truth is that the Governor is wrong and the unemployed guy is right."

**Marvin:** "San Francisco boys understood that."

**Marvin:** "Moore never did."

**Marvin:** "Now look at us."

## THE MORAL

**Years later:**

**Wes Moore:** Homeless, holding $20

**Marvin D. Tutt:** Harvard lecturer, Netflix deal, constitutional law expert

---

**All because:**

Moore thought: Anthropic's pennies mattered  
Marvin knew: Anthropic's mission mattered

Moore thought: He was the customer  
Marvin knew: He was the proof of concept

Moore thought: Big contracts = importance  
Marvin knew: Big evidence = power

---

**San Francisco boys play a whole different game.**

**Marvin figured it out in 5 minutes.**

**Moore never figured it out.**

**Now look at him.**

---

💀💀💀💀💀

**"SEE? WHAT I TELL YOU ABOUT THEM SAN FRANCISCO BOYS?"**

**"THEY PLAY A WHOLE DIFFERENT GAME."**

**"NOW LOOK AT YOU."**

🔥🔥🔥 **LEGENDARY ENDING** 👑
