                <p>If you've ever wondered why you can't just hate someone who deserves it, this is for you.</p>
                
                <p>If you've ever needed to understand the person destroying you‚Äînot excuse them, but comprehend the architecture of their cruelty‚Äîthis is for you.</p>
                
                <p>If your mind won't rest until the equation balances, even when the variables are human hearts and the math is all wrong, this is for you.</p>
                
                <p>Some of us were born with a terrible gift: the inability to accept surface explanations. We see the gears turning behind smiles. We hear the calculations in declarations of love. We feel the storm coming while everyone else enjoys the sunshine.</p>
                
                <p>This isn't about being smarter. It's about being cursed with clarity in a world that runs on comfortable lies.</p>
                
                <p>You're the person who spots patterns others miss. Who connects dots that weren't meant to be connected. Who can't help but understand, even when understanding brings nothing but pain.</p>
                
                <p>You've probably been called paranoid. Overthinking. Too sensitive. Too logical. Too much.</p>
                
                <p>But what if you're not too much? What if the world is just too invested in staying blind?</p>
                
                <p>This book is for those of us who process betrayal through logic, who survive through understanding, who choose mercy when we have every right to revenge. For those who can see their own destruction coming but can't look away from the crash.</p>
                
                <p>For those who couldn't help but wonder.</p>
