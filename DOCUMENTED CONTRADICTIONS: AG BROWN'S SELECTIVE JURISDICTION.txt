Attorney General Brown's Selective Jurisdiction Syndrome

  On June 27, 2025, the Maryland Attorney General's Civil Rights Division stated in writing they have "no authority to address complaint against government agencies" and cannot investigate "patterns of
  misconduct" by Maryland state agencies.

  Yet this same office now:
  - Sues the federal government (a government agency)
  - Challenges nationwide immigration policy
  - Claims authority over international human rights
  - Fights for data privacy of 79 million Americans
  - Investigates patterns affecting people globally

  The Mathematical Impossibility:
  If the AG lacks jurisdiction over Maryland agencies harming Maryland citizens, how does he gain jurisdiction over federal agencies affecting international populations?

  The Pattern:
  - June 27: "Cannot investigate Charles County DSS" (20 miles away)
  - July 18: "Will investigate federal DHS" (nationwide)
  - June 27: "Cannot address Maryland garnishment fraud"
  - July 18: "Will address global privacy violations"

  The Only Logical Conclusions:
  1. The AG suffers from selective amnesia regarding his authority, OR
  2. The AG's jurisdiction mysteriously expands beyond Maryland's borders while vanishing within them, OR
  3. The AG consciously discriminates against Maryland citizens seeking help

  This documented contradiction between claimed limitations and actual actions suggests either cognitive impairment requiring evaluation or deliberate discrimination requiring accountability.

  A man who cannot help citizens in Temple Hills but can help citizens in Tibet deserves neither position nor credibility.

Attorney General Brown argues that ICE access to Medicaid data will deter people from seeking medical care due to privacy fears. He states immigrants will avoid hospitals, leading to "worse health
  outcomes."

  Yet this same Attorney General:
  - Refused to investigate violations of my civil rights
  - Declined jurisdiction over state agencies affecting my health
  - Ignored documented patterns harming Maryland citizens' wellbeing
  - Told me to find a private attorney with $203 to my name
  - Created an environment where Maryland citizens know seeking help is futile

  The Parallel:
  - Brown: "Immigrants won't seek care if government ignores their needs"
  - Reality: I sought help for civil rights violations and was turned away
  - Brown: "Fear of government prevents healthcare access"
  - Reality: His office's rejection prevents justice access

  The Message His Office Sends:
  When Maryland citizens facing health-impacting discrimination seek help, they're told it's "outside our jurisdiction." But when non-citizens face potential federal monitoring, suddenly jurisdiction
  appears.

  If government indifference deters people from seeking help, then Attorney General Brown's documented refusal to investigate Maryland agencies contributes directly to that deterrence.

  A man who denies help to suffering Maryland citizens while championing help for others demonstrates either:
  1. Selective memory about his authority (requiring evaluation)
  2. Selective application of his authority (requiring accountability)
