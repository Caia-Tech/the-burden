## Suggested Organization - Three Approaches:

**A. The Journey Structure** (Linear progression)
1. Fear/Courage → Power/Powerlessness → Force/Submission → Trust/Betrayal (The Shattering)
2. Madness/Sanity → Humor/Seriousness → Honesty/Deception → Memory/Forgetting (The Questioning) 
3. Poverty/Abundance → Creation/Destruction → Hope/Despair (The Rebuilding)
4. Love/Hate → Violence/Peace → Justice/Injustice (The Reckoning)
5. Solitude/Connection → Strength/Weakness → Pride/Shame (The Integration)
6. Restraint/Indulgence → Freedom/Captivity → Ruthlessness/Mercy (The Transcendence)
7. Blissful Ignorance/Painful Reality (The Choice)

**B. The Thematic Clusters** (Grouped by relationship)
- **Survival**: Fear/Courage, Power/Powerlessness, Force/Submission, Strength/Weakness
- **Truth**: Honesty/Deception, Madness/Sanity, Humor/Seriousness, Memory/Forgetting, Blissful Ignorance/Painful Reality
- **Resources**: Poverty/Abundance, Creation/Destruction, Freedom/Captivity
- **Relationships**: Love/Hate, Trust/Betrayal, Solitude/Connection
- **Justice**: Justice/Injustice, Violence/Peace, Pride/Shame
- **Balance**: Restraint/Indulgence, Ruthlessness/Mercy, Hope/Despair

**C. The Spiral Structure** (Deepening with each pass)
- Start with most accessible (Fear/Courage)
- End with most profound (Blissful Ignorance/Painful Reality)
- Each dichotomy builds on previous understanding

These particular dichotomies emerged from observing how humans navigate impossible situations, find meaning in suffering, and discover strength through adversity. Many more exist - perhaps you'll recognize your own as you read.
