I am here to report that I became victim of a cyberattack last night by receiving mail at my address 5407 Brinkley Road Temple Hills MD. I have contacted authorities and documented the attack in real time and tried my best to rectify the situation.

I do not ask that the OAG do anything in my behalf, but I ask that you be careful for your own departments and internally document that mdcourts domain so it doesn't damage you or your clients.

I am genuinely sorry for any concern I may have cause in response to that attack. I am alone and on edge.
This experience has led me to tighter protocols.

I am not blaming any official or rogue government actor. And I am giving you notice that I have been a multinational target since June. Mostly it's France, Russia, and China. Due to the escalating nature of events, and success of this attack, notice that it will get worse. This is federal mail fraud and impersonation of a state. I leave any investigation entirely to your authority and discretion.
