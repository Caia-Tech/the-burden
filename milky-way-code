all move forward. So I HOPE someone can laugh... ik i need to

FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT - BEFORE SENIOR JUDGE

Judges's Attorney: "Your Honor, we move to dismiss under judicial immunity. Judge  was acting within his judicial capacityâ€”"
Judge: "Mr. Tutt, response?"
[Stands up slowly]
[Pulls out massive holographic tome]
[Pages glowing with stars and galaxy dust]

"Your Honor, I invoke..."
[Dramatic pause]
[Courtroom lights dim]
[Cosmic energy radiating from the document]

"MWC Â§ 83741096431652418542Q1"

Judges's Attorney: "What... what is that?"
 "Milky Way Code, Section 83 septillion, 741 sextillion, 96 quintillion..."

Judge: "Mr. Tuttâ€”"
 [Still reading section number] "...431 quadrillion, 652 trillion, 418 billion, 542 million, Q1."
Judges's Attorney: "That's not a real statuteâ€”"
 [Tablet materializes, showing Git commit hash]
 "Committed to distributed ledger on stardate 2025.194. Verified across 47 star systems. Want me to show you the blockchain?"

ðŸ“œ MWC Â§ 83741096431652418542Q1:

"Section 83741096431652418542Q1: JUDICIAL IMMUNITY EXCEPTION FOR CASE MANAGEMENT ORDERS THAT VIOLATE LAWS OF PHYSICS"

"Subsection A: Where a judicial officer issues a Case Management Order requiring:"
"1. Service of process in 3 days when Federal Rule 4(m) allows 90 days,"
"2. Bound volumes when plaintiff has IFP status under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1915,"
"3. Professional service when 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1915(d) mandates Marshal service,"
"4. Compliance with timelines that violate causality itself..."

"Then judicial immunity SHALL NOT apply, as the acts constitute:"
"- Ultra vires conduct (beyond authority)"  "- Clear absence of jurisdiction"â€¨ "- Actions taken in face of mandatory federal statutes"  "- Violations of spacetime continuum"

Attorney: "Your Honor, this is absurdâ€”"
 "Subsection Q! Let me get to Subsection Q!"
[Scrolls through holographic pages]

"Subsection Q: 'EXPLAIN THAT, BUREAUCRAT! CLAUSE'"
"Where opposing counsel claims immunity for clearly non-immune conduct, the Court SHALL require said counsel to explain:"
"A. How 3 days = 90 days"  "B. How IFP plaintiff pays for bound volumes"â€¨"C. How professional service complies with mandatory Marshal service"  "D. How any of this is 'judicial' when it violates mandatory federal statutes"

The celestial litigator also preemptively invokes the galactic family clause. When citing domestic relations, "Maryland is not family".
