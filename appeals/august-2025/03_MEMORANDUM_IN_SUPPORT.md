*Plaintiff,*

v.

**STATE OF MARYLAND, et al.**  
*Defendants.*

**Case No.: 8:25-cv-02006-DKC**

---

## MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION

## INTRODUCTION

This Court dismissed a federal civil rights action in 48 hours after suspicious reassignment from a judge who had just been sued in the case. The timeline alone demands reconsideration:

- **Day 1**: Plaintiff sues presiding Judge Chuang
- **Day 7**: Judge Chuang removed without explanation  
- **Day 9**: New judge dismisses case entirely

No complex federal case warrants 2-day disposal. The haste reveals improper motive.

## STATEMENT OF FACTS

### The Original Claims

Plaintiff filed suit June 23, 2025, alleging Maryland officials conspired to:
- Garnish wages based on phantom income
- Allow private entities to act as co-plaintiffs
- Create conflicts of interest through revolving-door employment
- Generate $3.2 billion through systematic fraud, with individual employees potentially facing personal liability unaware of their superiors' broader scheme

### The Judicial Misconduct

On July 8, Judge Chuang issued discriminatory orders treating Plaintiff worse than prisoners. On July 15, Plaintiff:
- Filed mandamus with Fourth Circuit (No. 25-1809)
- Added Judge Chuang as defendant for $1 (nominal damages)
- Warned other judges would be added after discovery

### The Suspicious Dismissal

Seven days after being sued, Judge Chuang vanished. Two days later, this Court dismissed everything as "domestic relations" despite:
- Only government defendants remaining
- Federal conspiracy claims
- Pending appellate proceedings
- No opportunity to respond

## ARGUMENT

### I. THE COURT ERRED IN CHARACTERIZING FEDERAL CLAIMS AS DOMESTIC

#### A. The Absurdity of "Domestic Relations" with Government Entities

This Court dismissed claims as "domestic relations" despite the remaining defendants being:
- **State of Maryland** (a sovereign entity)
- **Charles County Child Support Administration** (a government agency)
- **Charles County Department of Social Services** (a government agency)
- **Charles County, Maryland** (a political subdivision)
- **Theodore D. Chuang** (a federal judge)
- **Various state attorneys and line-level employees** potentially unaware of institutional fraud

**Regina Robinson - the ONLY person who could conceivably trigger "domestic relations" - was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice before this Court's ruling.**

How does one have a "domestic relationship" with:
- A state government?
- County agencies?
- Federal judges?
- State attorneys?

This is not error - it's absurdity. The Court either:
1. Never read who the defendants were
2. Deliberately mischaracterized to achieve dismissal
3. Used a boilerplate dismissal without analysis

#### B. Rooker-Feldman Is Inapplicable

This Court invoked *Rooker-Feldman* to avoid federal claims. This was error because:

1. **No state court judgment challenged**: Plaintiff challenges ongoing garnishments, not past judgments
2. **Federal claims independent**: Conspiracy under § 1983 exists regardless of state proceedings
3. **Supreme Court precedent**: *Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Industries*, 544 U.S. 280 (2005) narrowly limits *Rooker-Feldman*

#### C. Domestic Relations Exception Doesn't Apply

The Court misapplied *Ankenbrandt v. Richards*, 504 U.S. 689 (1992):

1. **No divorce/custody issues**: Case involves government corruption
2. **No family status determination**: Only constitutional violations
3. **8 named government defendants plus Does**: Not a family dispute
4. **Other federal judges awaiting addition**: Dismissal prevented naming them

### II. THE REASSIGNMENT AND DISMISSAL PATTERN PROVES MISCONDUCT

#### A. The Timeline Is Dispositive

```
June 23: Complaint filed
July 8:  Judge Chuang issues discriminatory orders
July 15: Plaintiff sues Judge Chuang + files mandamus
July 22: Judge Chuang removed (no explanation)
July 24: Case dismissed by replacement (48 hours)
```

This sequence defies innocent explanation.

#### B. Due Process Violations

*Mathews v. Eldridge*, 424 U.S. 319 (1976) requires:
1. Notice and opportunity to respond
2. Neutral decisionmaker
3. Meaningful review

None occurred here.

### III. THE COURT'S ACTIONS VALIDATE PLAINTIFF'S CONSPIRACY CLAIMS

By dismissing immediately after judicial reassignment, the Court inadvertently proved:
1. Judges coordinate to protect each other
2. Cases get reassigned to achieve outcomes
3. Federal rights yield to judicial convenience
4. The system protects itself over citizens
5. **Lower-level employees risk bearing consequences** for policies they didn't create but were required to enforce

### IV. RECONSIDERATION STANDARDS ARE MET

Under Rule 59(e), reconsideration is warranted for:
1. **Clear error of law**: Misapplying *Rooker-Feldman*
2. **Manifest injustice**: Denying federal forum for federal claims
3. **New evidence**: The reassignment pattern itself

*See Hutchinson v. Staton*, 994 F.2d 1076 (4th Cir. 1993).

### V. THE INSTITUTIONAL TRAP: WHEN COMPLIANCE BECOMES COMPLICITY

Plaintiff recognizes that corruption can become so institutionalized that well-meaning employees find themselves trapped in an impossible position. When fraudulent practices become standard operating procedure, individual workers face an unconscionable choice: follow illegal directives to keep their jobs and support their families, or refuse and face retaliation.

This systematic normalization of misconduct does not excuse the violations, but it helps explain how dedicated public servants can become unwitting participants in federal crimes. Many defendants likely believed they were simply doing their jobs, unaware that their supervisors had designed a system violating federal law.

The real tragedy is that these employees—who may have served Maryland citizens faithfully for decades—now face potential personal liability for institutional decisions they neither made nor fully understood. They deserve protection from a system that placed them in legal jeopardy without their knowledge or consent.

Reform, not retribution, serves the public interest.

## CONCLUSION

This Court inherited a case 48 hours before dismissing it. The prior judge fled after being sued. The timeline screams impropriety. Plaintiff sought $1 from Judge Chuang - not money, but accountability. The response was case assassination.

Justice requires reconsideration.

## PLAINTIFF'S COMMITMENT TO RESOLUTION

While Plaintiff intends to vigorously pursue this appeal based on the documented judicial misconduct and wrongful dismissal of federal claims, Plaintiff remains open to comprehensive resolution that addresses:

1. **Immediate Relief**: Cessation of fraudulent garnishments based on phantom income
2. **Just Compensation**: Fair damages for destroyed career, medical emergencies, and ongoing harm  
3. **Systemic Reform**: Meaningful changes preventing recurrence of these violations
4. **Innovation Recognition**: Acknowledgment of GitForensics and other technological contributions

Plaintiff seeks justice, not prolonged litigation. Should Defendants demonstrate genuine commitment to addressing these core issues, Plaintiff reserves the right to dismiss this appeal in favor of negotiated resolution. This case arose from government agencies filing as co-plaintiffs with private citizens—an unprecedented abuse that demands remedy, not entrenchment.

Plaintiff's door remains open to good-faith dialogue that serves justice and the public interest.
