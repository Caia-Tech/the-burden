# MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION UNDER RULE 59(e)

**IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT**  
**FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND**

**MARVIN TUTT**  
*Plaintiff,*

v.

**STATE OF MARYLAND, et al.**  
*Defendants.*

**Case No.: 8:25-cv-02006-DKC**

---

## MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF DISMISSAL ORDER

Plaintiff Marvin Tutt respectfully moves this Court pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) to reconsider its Order of Dismissal entered July 24, 2025. This motion is based on clear errors of law and newly discovered evidence of judicial coordination.

## I. THE COURT COMMITTED MANIFEST ERRORS OF LAW

### A. Federal Claims Cannot Be Recharacterized as Domestic Relations

The Court dismissed this case as "domestic relations" despite the defendants being:
- State of Maryland
- Charles County Child Support Administration
- Charles County Department of Social Services  
- Charles County, Maryland
- Theodore D. Chuang (federal judge)
- Multiple state attorneys and officials

**The absurdity cannot be overstated**: How does one have a "domestic relationship" with the State of Maryland? With a federal judge? With government agencies?

**Regina Robinson** - the ONLY defendant with any familial connection - **was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice** on July 15, 2025, nine days before this Court's ruling.

This leaves 8 named government defendants plus 1-30 Does (which would include the other 14 federal judges Plaintiff intended to add). Not one is related to Plaintiff by blood or marriage. 

**Critically**: The precipitous dismissal occurred just as Plaintiff was preparing to formally add the remaining Maryland federal judges as defendants, as warned in the mandamus petition. The timing suggests the Court acted to prevent these judicial defendants from being named.

The Court's characterization is either:
1. **Gross error** - Failed to read who defendants were
2. **Deliberate mischaracterization** - Knew but dismissed anyway
3. **Predetermined outcome** - Used template without analysis

### B. The Court Ignored Pending Fourth Circuit Proceedings

The dismissal occurred while Plaintiff's mandamus petition (No. 25-1809) was pending before the Fourth Circuit, raising the exact judicial bias issues that manifested here.

## II. THE TIMELINE REVEALS IMPROPER COORDINATION

The Court must reconsider based on this undisputed sequence:

**July 15, 2025**: Plaintiff adds Judge Chuang as defendant for judicial misconduct  
**July 22, 2025**: Judge Chuang mysteriously removed (7 days later)  
**July 24, 2025**: Your Honor dismisses entire case (2 days after assignment)  

This timeline demonstrates:
- Unprecedented speed suggesting predetermined outcome
- No explanation for Judge Chuang's removal after being sued
- 48-hour "review" of complex federal conspiracy claims
- Dismissal preventing Plaintiff from adding other judicial defendants
- Does 1-30 specifically reserved for additional defendants including federal judges

## III. THE DISMISSAL ITSELF PROVES THE ALLEGED CONSPIRACY

The Court's actions validate Plaintiff's claims:

1. **Consciousness of Guilt**: Innocent judges don't orchestrate rapid dismissals
2. **Abuse of Discretion**: Two days insufficient for meaningful review
3. **Procedural Violations**: No opportunity to respond or amend
4. **Pattern Evidence**: Exactly what mandamus petition predicted

## IV. MANIFEST INJUSTICE REQUIRES RECONSIDERATION

The Court's dismissal:
- Rewards judicial misconduct
- Denies access to courts
- Validates corruption through procedure
- Creates precedent that judges can dismiss cases to avoid being defendants

## V. REQUEST FOR STAY PENDING RESOLUTION

Given the ongoing irreparable harm, Plaintiff further requests this Court stay enforcement of its dismissal order and enjoin continued garnishments while this motion is pending. Specifically:

### A. Irreparable Harm Continues Daily

1. **Weekly Garnishments**: $347 illegally taken every week
2. **Survival Threat**: Plaintiff has only $141.37 total assets
3. **Evidence Destruction**: August 4 state buyout eliminates witnesses
4. **Statute of Limitations**: Claims expire during proceedings

### B. Balance of Equities Favors Stay

- **Plaintiff loses survival money weekly without stay**
- **Defendants lose nothing from temporary stay**
- **Public interest favors preventing ongoing illegal garnishments**
- **Judicial economy favors resolving before appeal**

## VI. RELIEF REQUESTED

Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court:

1. **Vacate the dismissal order**
2. **Stay enforcement pending resolution of this motion**
3. **Enjoin garnishments while motion pending**
4. **Recuse from this matter** given appearance of coordination
5. **Transfer to another district** per 28 U.S.C. ยง 1404
6. **Alternative**: Certify for immediate appeal under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(b)

## VII. THIS COURT SHOULD EXPLAIN THE REASSIGNMENT

At minimum, this Court should explain:
- Why Judge Chuang was removed 7 days after being sued
- How a 77-year-old judge was assigned this complex case
- Why no explanation was provided for reassignment
- How 2 days sufficed to review 66 pages of federal claims

**WHEREFORE**, Plaintiff respectfully requests this Court grant this motion, vacate its dismissal order, and stay enforcement pending resolution.

**Respectfully submitted,**
