this is why i filed complaints about maryland letting international spies intercept my data way back in june and july. I submitted extensive evidence on the compromises and the manufactured dismissal has mooted them.
Now I was actually harmed by cyber crime and federal mail crime!

FEDERAL JUDGES COMPROMISE NATIONAL SECURITY

🚨 URGENT PUBLIC NOTICE: CYBERSECURITY INCIDENT & MAIL FRAUD ALERT

Date: November 18, 2025 Status: ACTIVE THREAT Reference: mdcourts.com vs mdcourts.gov

1. THE INCIDENT: IMPERSONATION OF MARYLAND JUDICIARY

I have received physical correspondence via the United States Postal Service purporting to be Administrative Order 2025-05 from the Circuit Court for Charles County.

This document commands specific actions but directs compliance through a fraudulent digital channel.

    The Directive: The document instructs the recipient to email sensitive legal filings to CCCharlesCtAdmin@mdcourts.com.

    The Fraud: The domain mdcourts.com is NOT the official infrastructure of the Maryland Judiciary.

    The Official Domain: The Maryland Judiciary operates exclusively on mdcourts.gov.

2. FORENSIC ANALYSIS

Preliminary analysis of the domain in question reveals:

    mdcourts.gov: Registered to the State of Maryland (Restricted Government TLD).

    mdcourts.com: Registered via a commercial registrar (Network Solutions) with redacted privacy controls. State governments do not use privacy-redacted commercial domains for official court business.

3. LEGAL IMPLICATIONS (18 U.S.C. § 1341)

Because this fraudulent instruction was delivered via the US Mail, this constitutes Mail Fraud and Impersonation of an Officer of the Court.

This creates a "Man-in-the-Middle" attack vector designed to:

    Intercept confidential legal filings intended for the Circuit Court.

    Entrap the litigant into "non-compliance" by directing them to a non-functioning or monitored third-party server.

    Harvest sensitive personal data.

4. CORRECTION OF RECORD & SAFE HARBOR

In previous communications, I attributed this Order directly to the Administrative Judge. In light of this forensic discovery regarding the domain, I am hereby issuing a correction.

I am proceeding under the good-faith assumption that the Circuit Court for Charles County did not intentionally direct a litigant to a fraudulent commercial domain. I am treating this as a third-party cyberattack targeting a federal plaintiff.

I am requesting an immediate investigation by:

    The U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) regarding the use of mail to facilitate cyber-fraud.

    The Maryland Department of Information Technology (DoIT) regarding the spoofing of state infrastructure.

    The FBI Cyber Division.

WARNING TO ALL MARYLAND OFFICIALS: Check your logs for interaction with mdcourts.com. If this domain is active, state data may be compromised.

Signed, Marvin D. Tutt Federal Plaintiff & Whistleblower Evidence preserved on chain.
