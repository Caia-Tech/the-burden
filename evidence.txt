Research - Real time internet search results get analyzed before answer output.

MCP - Think of it like a connector. It allows AI to access tools, like setting your calendar, checking the weather, or scheduling a meeting. Think if LLMs can now do what bots currently do. Most people won't use it but developers will.

I wrote a free book about seeing through workplace BS and navigating hostile systems

Hi everyone. I made a free book for people who see patterns in dysfunctional systems - especially at work.

It's NOT about fighting or destroying systems, but about understanding how they actually work so you can navigate them without losing yourself.

Some key topics:

- Why restraint is sometimes your strongest weapon

- How to document everything without going insane

- Pattern recognition as a survival tool

- Building boundaries in exploitative environments

- The hidden "rules" nobody tells you

- Preserving your humanity in dehumanizing systems

I wrote this while navigating my own nightmare with state systems (check my post history if curious). Everything I learned about protecting yourself while inside hostile bureaucracies is in there.

Completely free. No ads, no upsells, no BS.

https://github.com/Caia-Tech/the-burden

website - theburden.org

Hope it helps someone. We shouldn't have to become master strategists just to survive work, but here we are.

Discovered Fraud and Massive rights violations.

Maryland federal case 25CV2006, new case. 80% of what i filed is visible at https://github.com/Caia-Tech/the-burden .

Basically- "Custodial" committed fraud by lying about income and the amount of overnights she had. So i complained to the court. Court ignored it and allowed it to continue. Then everything just got worse and worse..... Guess what else? The child support agency teamed up with her to sue me directly, because if they followed the normal procedure in court, it would have got denied because I was a special case. This was worse than fraud, it was criminal conspiracy.

My Novel Idea to use Git as a Transparent Forensic Tool was rejected by "Developers"

No arguments were made against the idea, besides personal attacks on me and against frivolous details. They only understand programs, and nothing of the human systems that use them. You can check my post history.

The Concept:

When you push documents to GitHub, you create evidence that's harder to fake than traditional methods because:

    Server timestamps - GitHub records when you pushed (can't be spoofed like local timestamps)

    Network effect - When others clone your repo, they create independent timestamps

    Distributed proof - Multiple copies across different systems = harder to tamper

    Audit trail - GitHub's API logs all activities permanently

Real World Example:

"I documented workplace harassment in a GitHub repo. When 50 colleagues cloned it, they unknowingly created 50 independent timestamps proving when those documents existed. The company couldn't claim I fabricated evidence after-the-fact."

Why It Works:

- Email can be "lost" or "never received"

- Local files can be backdated

- But GitHub creates multiple layers of verification:

- Your push timestamp

- Server logs

- Clone records

- Fork history

- Issue/PR references

Not claiming it's perfect - just that it's better than most current methods and creates reasonable evidence for disputes.

I proved this works. I'm not debating it, I'm already using it.

Edit: JUST ask AI

I said it in the post, emails can be controlled. Also, they are not public. there is no verification someone downloaded your files. There are also size limits. Much better to use both together. Workplace violation occurs, you send to your colleagues. They download it, then they take administrative action. thus they create more and more timestamped evidence.

Something doesn't have to be "public" to be "forensic."

The M365 UAL will for sure tell us whether someone downloaded a file or read an email. The admins can go in and see if it was delivered.

The end user can't alter or modify any of those.

I don't see how this adds anything to what already exists.

How does the "human element" factor into what's captured by the MS UAL?

I understand what you're doing but it just seems like you're adding a layer that is duplicative of functionality that already exists.

There's no HARM in doing what you're doing other than putting in effort for basically no value at all.

Still saying i didnt generate value without reviewing it all? ... this is from claude: here's what GitHub gave me that M365 UAL couldn't:

    Cross-jurisdictional access - Federal investigators from multiple agencies accessed without subpoenas or permissions

    Real-time public monitoring - I could see WHO was investigating WHEN (clone analytics)

    Adversarial documentation - The defendants themselves cloned it, creating evidence of their knowledge

    Zero cost - I had $0, no lawyer, no IT department

    Psychological impact - Public transparency changed behavior patterns

1.) You can give those investigators access to your MS UAL via global read if you want.

2.) I can see security risks by having your data and logs able to be monitored in real time by the public.

3.) If this adversarial documentation is just a duplicate of what already exists, you don't gain anything.

4.) UAL is already $0 cost

5.) The point of forensics is not to change behavior patterns and again the publication of your logs may have other security implications.

because that's the exact case 155+ unique investigators cloned.

no ruling yet but there will be. the evidence is undeniable, any (honest, neutral) lawyer will tell you this is the real deal. Claude or gemini will too. gpt if you can fit the context.

a state agency filing with a private citizen is the kind of thing that doesn't need a ruling. If you know basic law, you see the problem here

If there's no ruling, you don't have "precedent."

And any ruling given by a court will not be on the merits of your idea here, so it's not really relevant.

"You could use GitHub to store evidence under ISO 17025 if you implement robust controls to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and traceability, and validate the platform‚Äôs use. However, due to the sensitivity of laboratory evidence (especially in forensics), a specialized system designed for compliance with ISO 17025 is likely a safer and more practical choice."

"However, it‚Äôs likely to face scrutiny due to GitHub‚Äôs nature as a general-purpose platform rather than a specialized evidence management system. This could be an issue in high-stakes cases, especially in digital forensics, where courts expect purpose-built systems designed for chain-of-custody and compliance. T"

An interesting new use case for Git and Github I *may* have discovered
Discussion

Has anyone used Git to document timestamped evidence? I think this could be a game changer for many.

Example, every time you complete homework for your classes, add it to a git repo. Then you should have almost no issue getting wrong grades corrected. And soon as your teacher finds out some of their students do this, they will become a lot more careful about grading.

Not saying I'm the first and only. But this should definitely be explored more.

Edit: what I learned from this thread and reddit account is that devs truly live in their own world. And support computer theory + other dev opinions more than real evidence.

Edit: even AI say's you're wrong. Ctrl +A and simply ask "Thoughts?" . You're welcome.

What this is is a highly visible trail that creates many more trails. Honesty isn't forced(impossible anyway) but honesty is the best play. a blockchain doesn't solve the problems- easy storage and sharing of large amounts of media, forensic trail that github clones create. github has the massive platform with professional logging. Way more human-connectable than some new app or blockchain with just immutable sigs. No need to rely on the computers to prevent lies, it's better to be so transparent that people can't lie and expect to get away with it forever. If i went back to change my repo now, 1000 people would say "why are our copies different? he can't be trusted"

Git timestamps can easily be forged, and history can be rewritten.

They might accept it, just as email headers are sometimes considered evidence (which are just as easy to forge), but on a technical level it‚Äôs shaky.

you may be able to use rfc 3161 to sign commit hashed with a trusted timestamp authority, example here https://github.com/Ocead/timestamping

this is actually a great example where you can explore how to use cryptography to create trusted digital evidence and ways to verify authenticity and integrity - would be a good resume example project

GitHub is indeed useful for this.

Everyone‚Äôs responding about rewriting history but:

    You can‚Äôt rewrite history for issues and comments, which is the best way to use it. Create an issue when assigned, comment when turned in.

    You can‚Äôt easily rewrite commit history in a coherent way.

Sure it‚Äôs technically possible to go in and rewrite an entire history but it most people who understand git would take the history of a repository as a legit timeline because it would be hard to fake without making mistakes.

If I say ‚Äúmanager requested X‚Äù on a date, then I make subsequent comments on how the request was changed or what was submitted when, it helps keep track of situations where assignments shift.

And to be honest there are times when it helps me stay honest, I forget things. (Usually it‚Äôs the other way but sometimes it keeps me honest).

Edit: but you can attach documents to comments. And that‚Äôs pretty helpful because unless you‚Äôre really being fraudulent it‚Äôs a reasonable record.

If you commit the artifact and mention the issue in the commit ‚Äúthis closes #54‚Äù then it‚Äôs pretty good proof. I think most people would accept it.

Of course if you‚Äôre a forger or liar then yeah it‚Äôs not e2e encrypted blockchain. But you know personal notes are admissible in court for example. There‚Äôs no perfect record (except the holy bible of course, which is literally true).
foogeeman

let's actually focus on the use case OP mentioned: A professor says you did not submit your assignment. You say but look at my commit timestamps and issues and comments! If I'm a professor I say f off, how do I know you're not a forger or a liar. I don't care about all that git, I only care about did I get the assignment on time.

Every digital assignment submission system has time stamps anyway so also if I'm the professor I say says here on Canvas that you submitted it late, so again f off.

This whole thing is stupid but you're taking it out of context and acting like the whole point isn't proving you're not a liar or a forger.
InnovativeBureaucrat
‚Ä¢
5h ago

If you think system A doesn't work (Canvas) then you use a different system to track your info. Github and Gitlab are great for that.

If you're really arguing about it weeks or months later and you have a record on paper (literal paper) that says "Submitted on Canvas 7/3/2025 8:25 PM", that's better than nothing. If you have something in Github, that's better and harder to alter. If you put it in comments (by commit or by commenting) that's even more evidence.

If it's a actual technical problem with the system or personal with the professor (maybe accidental), then your records will help so long as anyone's willing to look at them. If you're dealing with people who don't want to examine the evidence, then no records will be helpful.

If you have a bunch of timestamps in a complex system with lots of checks and balances in place, I don't think the first thing a dean would say is "well maybe this student went in and created a fake diary after the fact to support their case". I think they'd look at things like "hmmm... we had 3 people or 300 people complain that their work was not accepted by this professor, or before a holiday, or on Friday's between 5 and 6PM.".

Git wouldn't be a great choice to confirm financial transactions, but it's pretty dang good for anything less rigorous.

even in that example you miss the point and real world use case entirely. a police report can be spoofed. A suspect sketch can be spoofed. but if it's done publicly and receives many copies, spoofs will get caught. and spoofers will know better than to spoof!

all the devs here are thinking in programs. They forgot real world systems exist
