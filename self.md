Every. Day. Refusing to become #3. Relief is simple,relief is attainable. Can't let any single judge trick me out of that position.

Personally, trying here is what really matters.

I had so much taken from me that can never be replaced.

but they know what i want. not a spectacle.

to protect civil rights
safety
peace
dignity
compensation
prospective relief

I don't expect them to do the right thing. But Maybe they will. I will make sure they have the chance. I will fight for it. I will favor an efficient solution.

One thing that really bothers me, is being violated by people who never even looked you in the eye before.

know something? Even though my record is clean now, pretty sure I can't get a job after burnout/awoling the NGA. Now after suing state? I'm done... People can Google me and see hmm this guy
tried to sue maryland and ~30 individuals and agencies? And this federal judge said it's "frivolous". heck. I'm STILL being garnished and amassing arrears for 82k salary i haven't made since March 2024!

nobody gives af anyway but my point is as much as i been through, I just want a normal life and to forgive, let go, and move on. Who tf wants to become a watchdog, a crusader, whistleblower-type whatever...
i just want to finish a degree in mathematics at a different school, and live in peace, get into research...


but yea... i'm trying to go back to the district and get out. even if i can't get a fair shake. Discovery is what I need and what I'm entitled to.
