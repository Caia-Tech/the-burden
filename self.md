Every. Day. Refusing to become #3. Relief is simple,relief is attainable. Can't let any single judge trick me out of that position.

Personally, trying here is what really matters.

I had so much taken from me that can never be replaced.

but they know what i want. not a spectacle.

to protect civil rights
safety
peace
dignity
compensation
prospective relief

I don't expect them to do the right thing. But Maybe they will. I will make sure they have the chance. I will fight for it. I will favor an efficient solution.

One thing that really bothers me, is being violated by people who never even looked you in the eye before.

know something? Even though my record is clean now, pretty sure I can't get a job after burnout/awoling the NGA. Now after suing state? I'm done... People can Google me and see hmm this guy
tried to sue maryland and ~30 individuals and agencies? And this federal judge said it's "frivolous". heck. I'm STILL being garnished and amassing arrears for 82k salary i haven't made since March 2024!

nobody gives af anyway but my point is as much as i been through, I just want a normal life and to forgive, let go, and move on. Who tf wants to become a watchdog, a crusader, whistleblower-type whatever...
i just want to finish a degree in mathematics at a different school, and live in peace, get into research...

but yea... i'm trying to go back to the district and get out. even if i can't get a fair shake. Discovery is what I need and what I'm entitled to.

guys... america... maryland... attorney general office

total silence is.. tough. Pro se with a serious case against state isn't for the weak. But... You have way more to lose than I do. Because I already lost it... We know how insane the khoury conflict is. you know it too, but you keep doing it. The records are there for anyone to discover. And yet I insist on quiet resolution still... Around the time the AG refused to investigate, i contacted media and oversight groups. Nothing. Then I started learning more. I've been doing way less than I could be doing. I know it's only been a short while for you but it's like eternity for me. But you know what happened to me is wrong... you know I caught you red handed in something most people miss. But you could have just gave me due process? could have stalled the order until my other mandate was over... I was practically begging for my life in those court rooms. I know the real issues are way bigger than ill ever know, but can you at least do SOMETHING to start fixing things? You make us take L's everyday... why can't you take one when you are caught??? Seriously. Refusing to investigate, sabotage, intense monitoring, "frivolous" wordage... everything made it worse.

why does it even matter? I can handle discovery... I can make SOME agreements with you. I don't want to burn everything to the ground. I guess charles county court alone is worried of precedent and mass case review. But you cause it. You allowed dss counsel to represent dss who enforces. Y'all know what you told my bm? She motioned to compel you to act [contempt] on me and you know what you told her? You referred her to CSA. let me get this straight. YOU TOLD HER TO ASK HER CO PLAINTIFF to enforce actions on me? If i was a lawyer, holy f. I don't even want to know the rest of your violations. PLEASE JUST A NORMAL LIFE. PLEASE.

citizens should NOT have access to governments like this! Why would you give a psychopath that kind of control. We need empathy and remorse checks for all plaintiffs in family court.

Please read this^ the disservice you are doing to use when you try to quash and bury civil rights isn't just horrible for us, it's catastrophic to institutions. social media? tiktok? I could have been campaigning there instead... i could have been emailing and calling places daily... Or word can get out "on its own". Why break the law and create so much reversible error? Why is your policy to dismiss even when meritous? especially against someone who is principled and hasn't exhausted every option...

This is why I'm dissapointed in the AG. Zero skill. zero contemplation. just POLICY. Then anybody can do it! If you job is risk analysis and you multiply risk, you deserve negative salary.

I get it now. They aren't top practitioners of law. law doesn't matter. just connections and power. I spend hours reading law just to get laughed at by the law.

I have several foia requests pending over 60 days. haven't pushed further. WHY does it have to go to this point. You know ill continue PIA and FOIA if I need to. you know records can be found even without discovery this time. You know I won't give up.

America, I keep feeling bad about the way I disrespected people. Raging at congressmen or the AG. implicating random case workers. IT SUCKS. 

America, y'all don't even know. When you file radioactive papers in federal court, before you know it it's ike you suddenly get pulled out from underwater but never knew you were underwater your whole life. It's just eerie QUIET. And when your case gets so big and complex that nobody else can or will comprehend... it's just rough.

I thought Spring Boot + JPA + Hibernate - that whole stack was the hardest thing I ever had to do. NOPE. It's pro se litigation. I had to learn both under constant threat. But litigation- different beast.
