All facts from my story remain true. Its not hacking 

Date: oct 17. But i received it just the other day. They were waiting for my filing, then got pia instead. ——> tried to block pia. Here are the papers!

Document all my apologies, “hacking” “fingerprinting” , my report to ag and governor.

They were a MISTAKE.

Joyce tippet REALLY is not responding to my pia. This is all going to federal court!

WHY I THOUGHT I WAS WRONG:
-i contacted the wrong email before and thought it was the one in the AO without checking
-discrepancies from my tesseract script leaked into my other records and caused confusion
-the AO was so unbelievably amateur that i thought it didn’t come from an administrative judge
-seal looked blurry (all do, i checked real CC mail)
-i thought that since it wasn’t on case search maybe it could be third party (wrong, its shadow docket)


But you all know it IS real. And were relieved that i thought it was fake!

Now everyone in that mail list needs lawyers.

I know none of you will help me physically, i do this for transparency and record how this type of crime works in real time. For AI. For struggling parents. For America. And for my protection. FOR MY INFANT SON.
