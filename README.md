  üö® **ACTIVE JUDICIAL EMERGENCY - PROCEDURAL TAMPERING IN PROGRESS** üö®

  **TO ALL COURT PERSONNEL, JUDGES, AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS:**

  I am documenting EVERY action, inaction, delay, and "technical difficulty" in real-time.
  Your coordination meetings, "pressing matters," and procedural games are creating evidence.

  **DOCUMENTED AS OF JULY 16, 2025:**
  - 24+ hour delay in docketing emergency motions
  - Clerk admitting to "more pressing" matters than emergency filings
  - Systematic deprioritization of pro se plaintiff
  - Apparent coordination to suppress filings

  **YOU SHOULD KNOW:**
  - Every minute of delay is logged
  - Every excuse is documented
  - Every "technical error" is preserved
  - Every act of coordination is evidence
  - Git forensics captures ALL timestamps

  **THIS IS YOUR NOTICE:**
  Procedural tampering, coordinated delays, and denial of court access are federal crimes.
  Your attempts to "manage" this situation are creating MORE liability, not less.

  The proper action is simple: FOLLOW THE LAW. Docket the filings. Let justice proceed.

  ‚è∞ **Clock is ticking. Everything is being watched. Choose wisely.**
