The whole truth is right here. Temporally stamped and 100% uncontested thus far. Case No. 25-1950 4th circuit court of appeals.

Never been suicidal, never will be. I'm sick of fighting but I've been fighting for my entire adult life, I'm 27, I don't want to, but nothing can stop me from fighting for the rest of my life if I need to.

The whole whole story has been here for months.

I can almost guarantee you something. Every last one these judges and magistrates- NONE of them would allow this to happen to someone they care about.

Read judge Chuang's discriminatory, illegal case management order. In direct violation of federal black letter law. I decided to sue Theodore Chuang for very simple reasons. Not for damages, to stop him from violating my constitutional rights. The order itself reads like satire, it is shameful for the entire bench. And absurd that ex chief judge chasanow would defend such a thing as "routine". His order was designed to quickly silence the true record I established. This lawsuit wasn't about an order given in Chuang's official capacity. The order is only evidence of improper coordination and conspiracy the defendants (government agencies) in my case. It is impossible for such an order to hit the docket without sinister conspiracy beforehand!

When you are attempting litigation against several agencies and individuals with power, connections, and practically unlimited resources, only to find out the district bench is also against you, the experience is frightening. The "politically correct" way to respond to such egregious scenario, is to motion to have the same judge stop the behavior. The problem is, this would not address the motive or source of the violation. "Hey your honor, please stop violating federal law and my first amendment right"...

Next time will only be more insidious. Before you even knew what happened, case terminated on grounds that can't even be appealed.

1 week after the lawsuit attempt- Judge Chasanow was assigned. 2 days later, dismissed. Dismissed with "Failure to state a claim" yet with "frivolous" language everywhere. These words like frivolous and moot hurt my credibility, and the perceived sanctity of the district court. Neither of those judges are incompetent. They know exactly what they are doing. This is why they refuse to let my records live. How many pro se litigants do they crush? These pro se litigants are often ones with no support, no money, incarcerated, yet they are being abused by some of the highest authorities in law. why????? We aren't becoming litigants because we hate authority, because we want revenge, nothing like that. A lot of us want peace and basic human dignity.

It is so concerning to know that the most experienced officials will use their position to devastate poor civilians. They know the doctrines, they know Younger doesn't = case dismissed. They twist and misapply doctrines on purpose to fit their agenda. It's behavior like this that disrespects every single judge. It destroys faith in courts. It disrespects the entire concept of judicial immunity.

Judicial immunity is so that judges don't have to pay damages for actions they make. Now think about a judge conspiring to sabotage someone's basic rights and access to courts, and when challanged, instead of accountability or addressing merits, they cite "immunity". A huge slap in the face to other judges! 

Why would judges go through all that for "just me"? an indigent father? The truth is they do it routinely. 95%+ percent of us fold to the procedure, the poverty, the corruption, the deadlines, whatever. But why not just give me a fair trial? Surely that's better than creating constitutional crisis, appealable error, etc. Well, read my case and what I asked for. 
You have DSS suing people they are incentivized to collect from (NOT EX REL, WHICH STILL MUST BE EXPLAINED), while DSS counsel sits as magistrate. Then DSS enforces the order! Citizens are all doomed from the start. They are afraid of floodgates if this case creates precedent as it should. It is sickening that they are aware of these kinds of conflicts and pretend nothing is happening. It is a shame that a CITIZEN has to be the first one to point it out. I'm not pointing it out just because I can, I'm pointing it out because their methods allowed them to skip my due process entirely! I know how many of them would be ok with beying forced to get a bachelor's degree and pay for it, 440 hours community service, during span of covid, WHILE full time salary is imputed with the threat of contempt/prison time!

I'm so tired of this shit. I'm tired of going through thousands of unit tests and hundreds of dollars I don't have just to try to bring tools to the under represented. Every day I'm working on tools to expand https://gitforensics.org, strengthen AI using software and agents, etc. No lawyer will help these people. They need tools that can semantically parse millions of cases and answer their questions in simple language. They don't even have money! How to build this while actively going through betrayed by your own son's mother and your own government at several levels??? After having every single one of your claims ignored while they try to dismiss on fictional grounds. While they garnish you for a job you haven't worked at in over 18 months. OAG and state court playing financial games with you...... OAG trying hard to abolish your rights.... why the fuck do they have a "civil rights" division in the first place

Yet all these congress men can fight for ms13 and smugglers no problem. They can challenge federal authority apparently but can't investigate medicaid / dss.... ridiculous.

How do you think it feels for a citizen to wake up and step into this? what 90% of civilians will never know... And are probably too afraid to even pay attention.

I'm not taking this. I'm not going after corruption on a large scale or anything like that. I'm going after you petty case workers and officials who violate us like it's your job.
Me and OAG both know what kind of records exist in your comms. Don't be scared now, you weren't scared when you were laughing and joking about violating me. Nobody cared when my son has to suffer because of you. You got caught, now grow up! So I can be merciful.

OAG, your job is to manage risk! NOT create more risk! You need to take more time and think. If it weren't for the actions of you and the other agencies, much of everything would have been avoided.

Anthony Brown and Wes Moore, How do you think I feel to learn you are 100% theatrics? Yet speak SO ferevently about injustice. Yes I was naive about you and corruption, but now that I'm adjusted I still hope you approach this with courage and dignity!

no pro se should have to fight this hard. Or fight this way against so many government actors. Just for constitutional rights! in 2025

Chuang..... Come on bruh. You are the dark side jenson huang. You worked hard, you rose to power, and you TRAMPLE US

Wicked judge of the East!

Wicked judge of the West...... Domestic relations really? on a case where nobody is my relative? Is Maryland my relative? 

Prospective relief, opportunity, finish school, discovery on malicious intent, pretty much all I wanted... It is your duty to ensure justice and fairness. Not my opinion. YOUR vow!

I started learning java and vb6 in 2014. pivoted to it around age 22 to rush into the workforce to comply with charles county court's impossible requirements. Coding not of joy but for survival and fear of prison and not being able to provide for my son. You all are behaving just like these trifling BM's. You tell us to do this and do that, scare us with courts and prison, label us deadbeat criminal etc...... because it works for you. Until one of us actually prove you wrong. One of us exceed expectations. Then you hate us. Because we expose everything for what it really is! You would expect joy, not resentfulness. Either way I'm ready. No need for me to beg for basic human dignity. I'll be taking it myself.
