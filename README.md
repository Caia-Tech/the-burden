Oct 15 - absolutely ridiculous. NEVER suicidal. Need that know here. and everywhere. I am proud to stand up for my myself and my rights. if something happens, protect my fight america

CALM. Not escalating. NOT investigating. not filing foia lawsuits or obstruction lawsuits. No new cases outside of fourth circuit appeal and state appeal. JUST CHILLING. while broke. while hurt. WHATEVER. JUST FIX QUIETLY, WITHOUT MORE RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. I DONT WANT MORE VIOLATIONS - MORE PROOF- MORE EMBARASSMENT -- I DONT WANT A SPECTACLE . I DONT WANT TO FIGHT YOU. I JUST WANT A NORMAL LIFE LITERALLY

Yea i laugh and joke but at the end of the day none of this is funny. Oct 15 - violated in state court. let the record speak for itself. y'all know my state case. Greer presided today. REVIEW IT OBJECTIVELY. not over-ly documenting it here. he is a fragment not worth my time.
