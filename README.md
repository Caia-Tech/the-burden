Not surprised... Whatever man. Entire court is conflicted. You have DSS counsel presiding over DSS plaintiffs, who both collect incentives and enforce orders. How do you schedule a federal defendant as magistrate over a plaintiff... No explanation stated, just ominous "bring proof of job search". Your agencies are so intermingled and used to corruption that you don't even see the issue. This 09/18/2025 hearing was only scheduled after judge Chasanow's memorandum opinion "Failure to state a claim" but also "frivolous". Also you assign Greer directly after call out? 

Most insidious, biased, arrogant system.

All i wanted was a normal life. You only want to keep our people in the system. When one of us complies, nothing changes. You make it impossible for us all. I'm done trying. It's not a court of law it's a complete joke. it's more of a sorority than a court. 1st amendment.

DO NOT escalate. My 1st, 8th, and 14th amendment rights were violated. See chuang and chasanow's orders here or in pacer. There is no question about this. When you put someone in an impossible situation and violate their basic rights and dignity what should you expect? 0 justice, 0 impartiality. Just risk management. NOT A COURT
