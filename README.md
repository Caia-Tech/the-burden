# Maryland Judicial Corruption - FOIA Campaign

## The Situation
Federal Case 8:25-cv-02006-TDC exposed systematic corruption in Maryland's judicial system. After the case was dismissed in just 2 days by a judge named as a defendant, I'm launching a comprehensive FOIA campaign to expose the truth.

**Key Facts:**
- Judge fled case after being sued for $1
- 77-year-old replacement judge dismissed in 2 days
- Governor announced buyout program 1 day after lawsuit
- AG refused to investigate documented corruption
- Weekly illegal garnishments continue, based on income from over 16 months ago.
- Original Co-plaintiff lawsuit against me was illegal.  Case Number:     C-08-FM-22-000821

## How You Can Help
Anyone can file FOIA requests. Pick one below and submit it. Corruption dies in sunlight.

## STRATEGIC NOTES FOR FOIA FILERS

### Documenting Ongoing Crimes
When requesting, emphasize:
- "Current and continuing" actions
- "As of [today's date]" 
- "Active" orders and authorizations
- "Ongoing" operations

This prevents them from claiming "historical" exemptions.

### The Power of Metadata
Even if you can't get documents, request:
- Access logs (who looked at files)
- Edit histories (who changed what)
- Email metadata (headers, routing)
- System logs (automated actions)

### Pattern Requests
Ask multiple agencies for the same info:
- Creates inconsistency risks
- Reveals coordination
- Multiplies pressure
- Catches lies through comparison

## IMPORTANT FOIA TIPS

- They can claim additional time, but must notify you
- No response = deemed denial (you can appeal)
- Mark your calendar when you send each request

### Fee Waivers
Always include this line: "I request a fee waiver as disclosure of this information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations."

### Expedited Processing
If ongoing harm, add: "I request expedited processing due to ongoing violations of civil rights and immediate threat to public interest."

## THE POWER OF NUMBERS

**If a few people file these requests:**
- Multiple requests across agencies
- Thousands of attorney hours to respond
- Impossible to coordinate denials
- Patterns become undeniable
- Cover-up becomes impossible

**If you're a victim:**
- Your case matters
- Your evidence helps everyone
- Your FOIA could break the case open

**If you're a citizen:**
- This is your government
- These are your courts
