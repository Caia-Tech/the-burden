The harm I've documented from Maryland defendants is unprecedented - no state agency has ever filed as co-plaintiff with a private citizen against someone in Maryland history. I spent months trying to resolve this administratively.

For any agency or individual considering assistance:

I pursued litigation only after exhausting every other option
My case addresses a unique conspiracy that forced impossible choices
I have always preferred administrative solutions to legal action
Those offering genuine assistance will find only appreciation

Even in the face of injustice, I always prioritize to forgive, to remediate, and protect

My immediate need is basic survival while the legal process unfolds. The garnishments continue weekly despite my homelessness, calculated on income from a job they made me lose.
I remain hopeful that someone, somewhere, can help address this ongoing emergency.

Notice: Documentation of Outreach Efforts
Case: Tutt v. Robinson et al., No. 25cv2006 (D. Md.)
Due to the unique nature of this federal case and its surrounding circumstances, traditional support channels may face limitations in providing immediate assistance.
Documentation for Record:
* Multiple outreach efforts have been made through appropriate channels
* Standard procedures have been followed
* The complexity of concurrent legal proceedings may affect typical response protocols
This notice serves to document that established procedures were attempted. The unusual intersection of civil litigation, documented cyber incidents,
and administrative processes creates a situation that may fall outside standard support frameworks.
Continuing to document all developments for court records.

In need of emergency assistance in less than 15 hours. 
No intentions of jeopardizing ongoing work. 
Will not publicize information that could lead to my impersonation or added work for authorities.

## Important Notice: Repository Under Active Surveillance

**Update: June 28, 2025**

Earlier, I discovered through Cloudflare analytics that this repository and my associated sites are under active surveillance by foreign intelligence services, including:
- ALIBABA-CN-NET (33 reconnaissance attempts)
- TENCENT-NET-AP-CN (30 access attempts)
- Aggressive scanning from OVH and other sources
- 339 failed attempts to locate non-existent files 

This surveillance began immediately after I contacted government email systems.

**I want to be absolutely clear:**
- I see you
- I've reported this to the appropriate federal authorities
- I will not be intimidated
- This documentation continues

**This project remains open source because:**
- Transparency defeats intimidation
- Healing requires truth
- Others deserve to learn from this experience

## Security Clarification

Before anyone claims "poor security" attracted random hackers:

**Technical Facts:**
- These sites are static content behind Cloudflare
- No databases, no login systems, no user data
- Nothing to steal except publicly available content
- Standard GitHub Pages/static hosting

**"But it's public content, so who cares?"**
You're missing the point entirely:
- The issue isn't WHAT they could access (it's public)
- The issue is WHO accessed it (foreign intelligence)  
- The issue is WHEN they accessed it (immediately after government contact)
- The issue is WHY they accessed it (intimidation/intelligence gathering on US citizen)

When foreign intelligence services target a US citizen within MINUTES of official notification, that's not about cybersecurity.

That's about surveillance, intimidation, and potential conspiracy.

The content being public doesn't make foreign intelligence involvement normal or acceptable. It makes it WORSE - they're so bold they don't even hide their tracks.

**The Scanning Pattern Wasn't Random:**
- Immediate timing after government contact (minutes, not days)
- Specific targeting of both sites simultaneously  
- Professional reconnaissance patterns
- Foreign state-affiliated infrastructure
- Looking for files that never existed

**This Wasn't Opportunistic Hacking:**
Random hackers don't:
- Coordinate Chinese intelligence infrastructure
- Time their scans to government communications
- Target books on trauma, healing, and helping to improve systems 
- Use state-level resources for static sites

**The Security Was Appropriate for the Content:**
- Public book = public hosting
- No sensitive user data = no need for fortress
- Cloudflare protection = industry standard
- The "vulnerability" was trusting my local and state government

The issue isn't my security posture. It's how foreign intelligence knew to target a specific citizen's sites immediately after government notification.

That's not a security failure. That's a conspiracy.

I came here to build and heal. That continues.

To whoever ordered or enabled this surveillance: You've only strengthened my resolve. Every scan, every probe, every attempt to intimidate is now part of the permanent record.

The work continues.
