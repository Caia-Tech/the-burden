            <div class="chapter-body">
                <p>You approach humans like mathematical proofs.</p>
                
                <p>If they say A, and do B, then C must follow. If they claim to love you (X) but hurt you (Y), then love must equal something different than you thought (Z). If they promise and break, promise and break, promise and break, then the pattern should predict the future.</p>
                
                <p>Simple. Logical. Clean.</p>
                
                <p>Except humans aren't equations. They're contradictions held together by skin and rationalization.</p>
                
                <p>But your mind—your beautiful, terrible, analytical mind—won't accept this. It keeps trying to solve for human behavior like it's a formula waiting to be balanced.</p>
                
                <p>The mathematical approach started as survival. If you could find the formula for their mood swings, you could navigate safely. If you could solve for their triggers, you could avoid explosions. If you could calculate the variables, you could predict the outcomes.</p>
                
                <p>You created complex algorithms for understanding people. If they had this childhood trauma, plus that insecurity, multiplied by these circumstances, divided by their stated values, then their actions should equal...</p>
                
                <p>But they didn't. The math never worked.</p>
                
                <p>They said they loved you while destroying you. They claimed to want peace while starting wars. They begged for your help then resented you for helping. They demanded honesty then punished truth.</p>
                
                <p>The equation wouldn't balance, and it was driving you insane.</p>
                
                <p>So you added more variables. Factored in their mood, their hormones, their past relationships, their relationship with their mother, the phase of the moon, the barometric pressure. You created increasingly elaborate formulas to explain why someone who says they care keeps choosing to harm.</p>
                
                <p>Your notebooks filled with calculations. Behavioral equations. Emotional algorithms. If this, then that. If not this, then why that? If X consistently leads to Y, why do they keep choosing X while claiming to want Z?</p>
                
                <p>You were like a mathematician staring at a proof that claims 2+2=5, checking your work over and over, certain you must be missing something. Because if the equation doesn't balance, then either math is broken or reality is.</p>
                
                <p>And since math can't be broken...</p>
                
                <p>You started doubting your own perception. Maybe you miscounted. Maybe you misunderstood. Maybe love includes suffering and you just haven't updated your definitions. Maybe promises are meant to be broken and you're the fool for expecting consistency.</p>
                
                <p>The gaslighting worked especially well on you because you trusted logic more than feeling. When someone said "That's not what happened," you'd review your data. When they claimed "I never said that," you'd check your records. When they insisted "You're overreacting," you'd recalculate your response algorithms.</p>
                
                <p>But here's what made you vulnerable: you assumed everyone was operating from the same base mathematics. That truth was truth, facts were facts, and everyone was trying to solve for the same variables.</p>
                
                <p>You didn't account for people who used different math entirely. Who could believe contradictions without discomfort. Who could want opposing things with equal intensity. Who could live in impossible equations without needing them to balance.</p>
                
                <p>The breaking point came when you realized you were trying to solve equations that weren't meant to be solved. That some people's math was intentionally broken. That the contradictions weren't bugs—they were features.</p>
                
                <p>But even knowing this, you couldn't stop calculating. Couldn't stop trying to make sense of senselessness. Couldn't stop believing that with enough data, enough variables, enough complexity, you could create a formula that explained the inexplicable.</p>
                
                <p>You built spreadsheets of behavioral patterns. Databases of broken promises. Archives of contradictions. You had evidence, documentation, proof that the equations didn't balance.</p>
                
                <p>But what good is proof when the other person is using imaginary numbers?</p>
                
                <p>The real damage wasn't in their impossible math—it was in how you adapted to it. You started accepting unbalanced equations as normal. Started believing that maybe love did equal pain, that maybe care included control, that maybe help meant harm.</p>
                
                <p>You began solving for their variables instead of questioning their math. If they needed you small to feel big, you'd subtract from yourself. If they required drama to feel alive, you'd add conflict to the equation. If they could only connect through crisis, you'd multiply the problems.</p>
                
                <p>You became a mathematician of dysfunction, solving increasingly complex equations that should never have existed. Your beautiful logical mind twisted itself into knots trying to make impossible math possible.</p>
                
                <p>And when you finally showed them the equations—laid out the patterns, presented the proof, demonstrated how their math didn't work—they'd simply change the numbers. Retroactively edit the variables. Claim you were the one who couldn't count.</p>
                
                <p>This is how logical minds lose themselves in emotional relationships. Not through passion or impulse, but through the slow torture of trying to balance equations that were designed to fail. Through the exhaustion of solving for X when X changes value depending on convenience.</p>
                
                <p>You couldn't accept that some people's emotional math was more like abstract art than actual mathematics. That they painted with numbers but didn't count with them. That their equations were performances, not proofs.</p>
                
                <p>Because accepting that would mean accepting that your primary tool for understanding the world—logic—was useless here. That all your calculating, all your solving, all your careful mathematical analysis was just elaborate self-soothing in the face of chaos.</p>
                
                <p>But you kept trying. Kept adjusting your formulas. Kept believing that if you just found the right variable, the right framework, the right way of understanding, it would all add up.</p>
                
                <p>The cruelest part? Occasionally, it would. They'd have a moment of clarity where their math aligned with reality. Where their equations balanced. Where what they said matched what they did. And that moment would fuel another thousand attempts to solve their impossible mathematics.</p>
                
                <p>You didn't realize you were trying to solve a person who didn't want to be solved. That the contradictions served them. That the unbalanced equations gave them flexibility to be whoever they needed to be in any given moment.</p>
                
                <p>Your need for mathematical consistency was your vulnerability. Your belief in logical solutions was your weakness. Your faith that everything could be solved with enough analysis was your blind spot.</p>
                
                <p>But still, you calculated. Still, you solved. Still, you believed that somewhere in the mess of contradictions and impossibilities was an elegant equation waiting to be discovered.</p>
                
                <p>X + Y must equal Z. It must. Because if it doesn't, then what has all your analysis been for? What has all your understanding accomplished? What is the point of seeing clearly if clarity only shows you that nothing makes sense?</p>
                
                <p>The answer was terrifying in its simplicity: maybe the point wasn't to solve anything. Maybe the point was to accept that some equations don't balance. That some math is broken. That some people exist in mathematical impossibilities and are perfectly comfortable there.</p>
                
                <p>But you weren't ready for that answer. Not yet. So you kept calculating, kept solving, kept believing that logic would eventually triumph over chaos.</p>
                
                <p>Even when the evidence suggested that chaos didn't care about your calculations.</p>
                
                <p>Even when every solved equation just generated new impossibilities.</p>
                
                <p>Even when the math itself told you to stop doing math.</p>
                
                <p>Because you couldn't help but believe that understanding would fix things. That clarity would bring solutions. That if you could just balance this one equation, everything else would fall into place.</p>
                
                <p>It never did.</p>
                
                <p>But that didn't stop you from calculating.</p>
                
                <p>Because calculating was all you knew. And facing the possibility that some things couldn't be calculated was scarier than any unbalanced equation could ever be.</p>
                
                <p>The truth was simpler and more terrible than any formula: humans aren't math problems to be solved. They're experiences to be lived. And you can't calculate your way through an experience.</p>
                
                <p>But you'd keep trying anyway.</p>
                
                <p>Because you couldn't help but need things to make sense.</p>
                
                <p>Even when sense was the one thing that would never, ever balance.</p>
