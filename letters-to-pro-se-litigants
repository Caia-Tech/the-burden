Somethings I learned:

Never overlook the importance of your initial complaint. The law books say pro se complaints are to be construed liberally and you should have at least one chance to amend. In actuality,
your opponents or judge will try to misstate, attack, and bury your complaint. They are supposed to accept your complaint as true and then decide the merits in court, but this is not how it works in reality.
In my case, I anticipated half their arguments. The other half made 0 sense. They will still try. So, your initial complaint must be air tight from the beginning. NEVER let them bury your records,
because that's how they intend to dismiss you right after they sweep your defenses. Never agree to anything that violates your rights or the law. They will misapply doctrine with no shame in the world.
Federal judge, ex chief, doesn't matter. Assume the only person willing to follow the law is you. It will save you a lot of shock. Don't rush the initial complaint, don't preserve most of your issues
in it either. Narrow it. You can add some things later, do your research. I share everything transparently because I have nothing to hide, but in many cases- the less they know, the better.

Recognize fear and feelings of danger. We are under pressure, it doesn't mean danger. It sure can feel like it though. When you research for countless hours only to see someone in a position of power
attempt to bury you, it is shocking. The constitution protects us here. Breathe. The reason we have constitutional rights and appeals court is because Americans knew that Americans would try to pull this exact crap.
It's normal, it's not personal. It shouldn't be normal but it is. If your case is wrongfully dismissed, document and petition your circuit. That's the way it's setup, use the avenues in place.

don't scream at institutions. It doesn't help. They are used to it. It will cost sanity and lead to isolation. I want a normal life, but so do government officials. So they're not going to risk their
"livelihood" over anything has to do with us. Got it?

Don't get your hopes up- don't put faith in morals of people you never even met. These people aren't God. They'll throw each other under the bus for brownie points. Think they care about your rights?

In litigation, give your opponents and judge(s) options. I learned this while thinking really hard some weeks after submitting my informal brief to the fourth circuit. Here is a paradox, you want
things to be simple for your circuit and they want simplicity as well, but you only have one chance at a brief. This means your future may be on the line, so you will no doubt feel inclined to preserve every
single thing you can. The solution for me was to suggest limited relief. By giving the court and opponents options, you accomplish several things. You show that you are reasonable and considerate of 
other parties, and while they may not give a damn, it forces them to choose. They can choose efficiency or they can choose complexity and risk + precedent. Effectively, you raise the cost of their actions.
You get them to consider multiple options, this also gives you more information. I gave them options naturally in the initial complaint as well, but it's something i didn't really notice the power of until recently.

Never give up
