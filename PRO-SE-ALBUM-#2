JUDGE ABELSON: "But he has TWO PORSCHES now..."
RUSSELL: "From settlements. That WE paid."

üéµ TRACK 7 - "CADILLAC" PLAYS:
"What's the next track? You said what's the next track?‚Ä®Pro se not a pimp but he got a Cadillac‚Ä®The state paid for it, now he driving on the track‚Ä®Now I want the 911 so I gotta take it back!"

JUDGE CHASANOW: [head in hands] "He wants ANOTHER car?"

JUDGE CHUANG: "Take WHAT back?"
RUSSELL: "Everything we tried to take from him, Theodore."

[UNCOMFORTABLE SHIFTING]

JUDGE HURSON: "Does he mention the Fourth Circuit reversal?"
RUSSELL: [grim] "It's the hook on Track 1."
JUDGE HOLLANDER: "Play it."

üéµ TRACK 1 - "JACKIE ROBINSON" PLAYS:
"Pro se all star, Jackie Robinson‚Ä®Knocking shit out the field‚Ä®Judge dismissed my case‚Ä®And then I filed an appeal"

JUDGE CHASANOW: [quietly] "That's... actually a perfect metaphor."
RUSSELL: "Deborah, you dismissed his case in 48 hours."
CHASANOW: "I know what I did, Chief."
RUSSELL: "And he compared himself to Jackie Robinson."
CHASANOW: "I KNOW, CHIEF."

JUDGE BLAKE: "Yo but the 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983 / Jackie Robinson #42 double entendre is INSANE."
ALL JUDGES: [nodding]
JUDGE GRIGGSBY: "The man is a poet."
JUDGE GALLAGHER: "The man beat half of us."
JUDGE MADDOX: "Both things can be true."

JUDGE XINIS: "What's the title track like?"

JUDGE BOARDMAN: "About the Maryland Attorney General‚Äî"
RUSSELL: "Yep."
JUDGE HURSON: "By name‚Äî"
RUSSELL: "Anthony Brown. Rashida Ogletree-George. James Spiker. HHS. All of them."

JUDGE CHUANG: "Is that... legal?"
RUSSELL: "It's protected speech, Theodore."
JUDGE CHASANOW: "It's also fire."
ALL JUDGES: [look at Chasanow]
CHASANOW: "What? We all thinking it."

JUDGE BLAKE: "Chief, what's your favorite track?"
RUSSELL: [doesn't hesitate] "Track 9. 'Pro Se Me vs O-A-G'"
JUDGE GRIGGSBY: "Why that one?"
RUSSELL: [plays it]

üéµ TRACK 9 - "PRO SE ME VS O-A-G" PLAYS:
"Pro se, me vs O-A-G‚Ä®I got Trump, I got Pam, Imma call Bondi"

[EVERYONE FREEZES]

JUDGE GALLAGHER: "Did he just say‚Äî"
JUDGE XINIS: "Trump and Pam Bondi‚Äî"
JUDGE MADDOX: "The U.S. Attorney General‚Äî"
RUSSELL: "He's got connections now."

JUDGE CHASANOW: [whispers] "We're cooked."
JUDGE CHUANG: [whispers back] "So cooked."

JUDGE HOLLANDER: "Wait, play that part again."
RUSSELL: [rewinds]
"I told Pam Bondi lock the AG up,‚Ä®The state locked me up when I was building me up,‚Ä®I told the President to look the docket up,‚Ä®The AG crazy if he thinking 'bout suing Trump"

JUDGE BENNETT: "He told the PRESIDENT?"
RUSSELL: "To look up the docket."
JUDGE ABELSON: "Does Trump know who he is?"
RUSSELL: "After 450,000 streams on album one? Probably."

JUDGE BOARDMAN: "Chief, how many streams does this album have?"
RUSSELL: [checks phone] "It dropped yesterday. Already at 180,000."
ALL JUDGES: "WHAT??"
RUSSELL: "TikTok picked it up again. The 'I got Trump, I got Pam' line is going viral."

JUDGE GRIGGSBY: "So let me get this straight..."
GRIGGSBY: "The pro se guy we dismissed..."
GRIGGSBY: "Who beat us on appeal..."
GRIGGSBY: "Made TWO albums about it..."
GRIGGSBY: "Got 600,000+ combined streams..."
GRIGGSBY: "And now has connections to the White House?"
RUSSELL: "Correct."
GRIGGSBY: "..."
GRIGGSBY: "We should probably settle."

[ALL JUDGES NOD]

JUDGE CHUANG: "How much are we talking?"
JUDGE CHASANOW: "Enough for the Porsche 911."
JUDGE BLAKE: "And then some."
RUSSELL: "Plus he wants it in writing that we were wrong."
JUDGE XINIS: "Are we?"
RUSSELL: [long pause] "The Fourth Circuit thought so."

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

CLERK: "Chief Judge Russell? There's a... situation."
RUSSELL: "What kind of situation?"
CLERK: "Someone just filed a motion to intervene."
RUSSELL: "Who?"
CLERK: "The U.S. Department of Justice."

üéµ "I got Trump, I got Pam, Imma call Bondi" üéµ
