# UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
## FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT
### ORAL ARGUMENT - TUTT V. STATE OF MARYLAND, ET AL.
### RICHMOND, VIRGINIA

---

## THE SCENE:

**THREE-JUDGE PANEL:**
- Chief Judge Albert Diaz (presiding)
- Judge Barbara Milano Keenan  
- Judge Toby Heytens

**APPELLANT:** Marvin D. Tutt (Pro Se, appearing remotely)

**APPELLEE COUNSEL:** Sarah Mitchell, Senior Assistant Attorney General, Maryland OAG

---

## 10:03 AM - ARGUMENT BEGINS

---

**CHIEF JUDGE DIAZ:** "Good morning. We'll hear argument in Case No. 25-1950, Tutt versus State of Maryland. Mr. Tutt, you may proceed."

**MARVIN:** *[on video screen, professional setup]*

**MARVIN:** "Thank you, Your Honor. May it please the Court—"

**JUDGE KEENAN:** "Mr. Tutt, before you begin, I want to commend you on your brief. For a pro se litigant, it's remarkably well-organized."

**MARVIN:** "Thank you, Your Honor. I've learned a lot from losing in district court."

*[JUDGES SMILE]*

---

**MARVIN:** "Your Honors, this case presents a straightforward question: Can district courts violate mandatory federal service rules for IFP plaintiffs and then dismiss the case when the plaintiff can't comply with impossible requirements?"

**MARVIN:** "The answer under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(d) is no. The statute says 'shall.' Not 'may.' Not 'at the court's discretion.' Shall."

---

**JUDGE HEYTENS:** "Mr. Tutt, what about the district court's finding that your claims were frivolous under § 1915(e)?"

**MARVIN:** "Your Honor, Judge Chuang spent six pages creating a case management order for a supposedly frivolous case. Then Judge Chasanow dismissed it in 48 hours. That contradiction alone shows error."

**JUDGE HEYTENS:** *[nodding]* "That is a rather remarkable discrepancy."

---

**MARVIN:** "Your Honors, I was under criminal mandate to complete a bachelor's degree. They created a co-plaintiff structure specifically to make compliance impossible. When I exposed the fraud, they didn't investigate—they continued garnishing."

**JUDGE KEENAN:** "The co-plaintiff structure does seem unusual."

**MARVIN:** "It's unprecedented in Maryland history, Your Honor. And it violated every principle of due process."

---

**CHIEF JUDGE DIAZ:** "Mr. Tutt, your time is up, but we appreciate your advocacy. Ms. Mitchell, we'll hear from the State."

---

## 10:18 AM - STATE'S ARGUMENT BEGINS

---

**SARAH MITCHELL:** *[approaches podium]*

**MITCHELL:** "Thank you, Your Honors. May it please the Court—"

**JUDGE KEENAN:** "Ms. Mitchell, can you explain the service requirement imposed on Mr. Tutt? Personal service within three days for an IFP plaintiff?"

**MITCHELL:** "Your Honor, the district court has discretion to manage its docket—"

**JUDGE KEENAN:** "But § 1915(d) says officers of the court 'shall' serve process. That's mandatory language."

**MITCHELL:** "Your Honor, we believe—"

---

**JUDGE HEYTENS:** "Ms. Mitchell, let me ask you about the factual characterization. The district court said the state case was filed 'ex rel.' But the docket shows separate co-plaintiffs. How do you square that?"

**MITCHELL:** "Your Honor, the substance is the same whether—"

**JUDGE HEYTENS:** "Is it? Co-plaintiffs suggests the state was an independent party, not acting on behalf of another. That seems significant for the domestic relations exception analysis."

**MITCHELL:** "Your Honor, I... that's a fair point."

---

**CHIEF JUDGE DIAZ:** "Ms. Mitchell, the record shows Mr. Tutt was unemployed when they kept trying to garnish his employment wages. For over a year. How does that happen?"

**MITCHELL:** "Your Honor, there may have been administrative delays—"

**JUDGE DIAZ:** "For over a year? While garnishing unemployment benefits at a rate calculated from the phantom employment income?"

**MITCHELL:** "..."

---

**JUDGE KEENAN:** "Ms. Mitchell, the magistrate who presided came directly from the Department of Social Services—the parent agency of the child support enforcement unit—with no cooling-off period. Correct?"

**MITCHELL:** "That's correct, Your Honor, but—"

**JUDGE KEENAN:** "And then presided over that same agency's case against Mr. Tutt?"

**MITCHELL:** "Your Honor, magistrates are judicial officers—"

**JUDGE KEENAN:** "Who worked for the plaintiff in the case for nine years?"

**MITCHELL:** "..."

---

**JUDGE HEYTENS:** "Ms. Mitchell, help me understand the timeline. The state proceedings concluded June 18th. Mr. Tutt filed federal suit June 23rd. The district court cited Younger abstention for 'ongoing' state proceedings. But they had concluded before the federal filing."

**MITCHELL:** "Your Honor, there were subsequent state proceedings—"

**JUDGE HEYTENS:** "After the federal filing. That's not how Younger works. You can't retroactively create abstention."

**MITCHELL:** "Your Honor, I understand but—"

---

**CHIEF JUDGE DIAZ:** "Ms. Mitchell, I'm looking at the Fourth Circuit reversal rate for this district. And I'm looking at this record. And I'm looking at a pro se plaintiff who's making better legal arguments than some attorneys who appear before us."

**CHIEF JUDGE DIAZ:** "What happened here?"

---

**LONG PAUSE**

---

**MITCHELL:** *[stares at notes]*

**MITCHELL:** *[looks up at panel]*

**MITCHELL:** *[looks at Marvin on the video screen]*

**MITCHELL:** *[deep breath]*

---

**MITCHELL:** "Your Honors..."

**MITCHELL:** "I can't do this anymore."

---

*[SILENCE IN COURTROOM]*

---

**CHIEF JUDGE DIAZ:** "I'm sorry, Ms. Mitchell?"

---

**MITCHELL:** "I can't do this anymore, Your Honor."

**MITCHELL:** "I've read this record."

**MITCHELL:** "I've read his brief."

**MITCHELL:** "I've read the district court orders."

**MITCHELL:** "And I can't stand here and defend this."

---

**JUDGE KEENAN:** "Ms. Mitchell—"

---

**MITCHELL:** "You see, he's indigent."

**MITCHELL:** "He was just trying to take care of the ones he loves."

**MITCHELL:** "He was trying to complete his education like the criminal court ordered."

**MITCHELL:** "And we conspired."

---

*[GASPS IN GALLERY]*

---

**CHIEF JUDGE DIAZ:** "Ms. Mitchell, you should probably stop—"

---

**MITCHELL:** "No, Your Honor. You asked what happened. I'm telling you what happened."

---

**MITCHELL:** "The child support agency and the private party filed as co-plaintiffs—unprecedented in Maryland history—to create an impossible situation."

**MITCHELL:** "Work full-time or go to school full-time. Can't do both. That was the trap."

**MITCHELL:** "When he got employment, they couldn't garnish it. So they kept billing him."

**MITCHELL:** "When he lost employment, they garnished his unemployment at the old rate."

**MITCHELL:** "The phantom income wasn't a mistake. It was a feature."

---

**JUDGE HEYTENS:** "Ms. Mitchell, I need to stop you there—"

---

**MITCHELL:** "And the magistrate? Judge Keenan, you asked about her. She left DSS and went straight to the bench. No cooling period. Because they needed someone who understood the system."

**MITCHELL:** "The other magistrate prejudged the outcome: 'You'll never get this terminated.'"

**MITCHELL:** "The district court imposed impossible service requirements and then dismissed when he couldn't comply."

**MITCHELL:** "All of it was designed to fail."

---

**MITCHELL:** *[looks directly at camera/Marvin]*

---

**MITCHELL:** "He is the IFP."

**MITCHELL:** "In forma pauperis. In the form of a pauper."

**MITCHELL:** "And we treated him like he was nothing."

**MITCHELL:** "Like his education didn't matter."

**MITCHELL:** "Like his rehabilitation didn't matter."

**MITCHELL:** "Like his relationship with his son didn't matter."

---

**MITCHELL:** "But it does matter."

**MITCHELL:** "He matters."

**MITCHELL:** "And I can't defend this anymore."

---

*[COMPLETE SILENCE]*

---

**CHIEF JUDGE DIAZ:** *[after long pause]*

**CHIEF JUDGE DIAZ:** "Ms. Mitchell... are you conceding the appeal?"

---

**MITCHELL:** *[closes her notebook]*

---

**MITCHELL:** "Yes, Your Honor. On behalf of the State of Maryland, we concede."

**MITCHELL:** "The district court erred."

**MITCHELL:** "Mr. Tutt's federal civil rights claims should not have been dismissed."

**MITCHELL:** "The service requirements violated § 1915(d)."

**MITCHELL:** "The domestic relations exception was misapplied."

**MITCHELL:** "Younger abstention was inappropriate."

**MITCHELL:** "And the 48-hour dismissal denied due process."

---

**MITCHELL:** "We request that this Court remand with instructions to grant Mr. Tutt leave to amend and proceed on his federal constitutional claims."

---

**MITCHELL:** *[pauses]*

---

**MITCHELL:** "And personally, off the record if possible..."

---

**CHIEF JUDGE DIAZ:** "Ms. Mitchell, nothing in this courtroom is off the record."

---

**MITCHELL:** "Then on the record, Your Honors: I apologize."

**MITCHELL:** *[turns to camera]*

**MITCHELL:** "Mr. Tutt, I apologize."

**MITCHELL:** "What we did was wrong."

**MITCHELL:** "You deserved better from your government."

---

*[MARVIN ON SCREEN: visibly emotional, nodding]*

---

**CHIEF JUDGE DIAZ:** *[long pause]*

---

**CHIEF JUDGE DIAZ:** "Ms. Mitchell, I've been on this court for twelve years. I've never seen anything like this."

---

**JUDGE KEENAN:** "In thirty years of practice and on the bench... neither have I."

---

**JUDGE HEYTENS:** "Ms. Mitchell, we appreciate your candor. Though I suspect your superiors will not."

---

**MITCHELL:** "I understand, Your Honor. But I took an oath to uphold justice."

**MITCHELL:** "Not to defend injustice."

---

**CHIEF JUDGE DIAZ:** "Mr. Tutt, do you have anything to add?"

---

**MARVIN:** *[wiping eyes]*

---

**MARVIN:** "Your Honor, I just... thank you."

**MARVIN:** "Thank you for hearing me."

**MARVIN:** "Thank you, Ms. Mitchell, for your honesty."

**MARVIN:** "I never wanted to be a folk hero or make albums or sue anybody."

**MARVIN:** "I just wanted to complete my degree and be there for my son."

**MARVIN:** "That's it."

---

**CHIEF JUDGE DIAZ:** *[nodding]*

---

**CHIEF JUDGE DIAZ:** "The Court will issue an order shortly."

**CHIEF JUDGE DIAZ:** "But I think we can say with certainty that we will reverse the district court's dismissal and remand for further proceedings consistent with Mr. Tutt's federal constitutional claims."

---

**CHIEF JUDGE DIAZ:** "Ms. Mitchell, we strongly encourage the State to engage in settlement discussions. This case should not have reached us. It should have been resolved long ago."

---

**MITCHELL:** "Understood, Your Honor. I will convey that."

---

**CHIEF JUDGE DIAZ:** "Anything else?"

---

**MARVIN:** "Your Honor, just... I hope this helps other parents. Other pro se litigants. Other people the system tried to break."

**MARVIN:** "Because if I can do this, anyone can."

---

**JUDGE KEENAN:** "Mr. Tutt, you've already helped them. This will be published. Every IFP plaintiff in the Fourth Circuit will benefit from this precedent."

---

**JUDGE HEYTENS:** "And frankly, from your example."

---

**CHIEF JUDGE DIAZ:** "Court is adjourned."

---

*[GAVEL]*

---

## IMMEDIATELY AFTER - HALLWAY

---

**REPORTER:** "Ms. Mitchell! Ms. Mitchell!"

**MITCHELL:** *[walking quickly]*

**REPORTER:** "Did you just concede a federal appeal?"

**MITCHELL:** "Yes."

**REPORTER:** "Why?"

**MITCHELL:** *[stops, turns]*

**MITCHELL:** "Because he was right."

**MITCHELL:** "And we were wrong."

**MITCHELL:** "That's it."

---

*[walks away]*

# MARYLAND OAG - CONFERENCE ROOM
## THIRTY MINUTES AFTER THE FOURTH CIRCUIT CONCESSION
## ANTHONY BROWN + SENIOR LEADERSHIP

---

**ANTHONY BROWN:** *[stone cold]*

**BROWN:** "Get Mitchell on the phone."

**RASHIDA OGLETREE-GEORGE:** "Sir, she's still in Richmond—"

**BROWN:** "I don't care if she's on the moon. Get her on the phone. NOW."

---

*[SPEAKERPHONE RINGS]*

---

**SARAH MITCHELL:** "Hello?"

**BROWN:** "Sarah. Conference room. Speaker. You're on with senior leadership."

**MITCHELL:** "Sir, I can explain—"

**BROWN:** "Oh, you're going to explain. You're going to explain how you tanked a Fourth Circuit appeal without authorization."

**MITCHELL:** "Sir, the record was clear—"

**BROWN:** "The record? THE RECORD?"

**BROWN:** "You admitted conspiracy in open court!"

**BROWN:** "On the record!"

**BROWN:** "In federal appellate court!"

---

**MITCHELL:** "Because it's true, sir."

---

*[DEADLY SILENCE]*

---

**BROWN:** "What did you just say?"

**MITCHELL:** "It's true. We did conspire. The co-plaintiff structure was designed to fail. The phantom income wasn't a mistake. I read the whole file, sir. All of it."

**BROWN:** "Sarah—"

**MITCHELL:** "Including the parts we tried to hide in discovery."

---

**RASHIDA:** *[interrupting]* "Sarah, stop talking."

---

**MITCHELL:** "No, Rashida. You stop talking."

**MITCHELL:** "I've been quiet for two years while we destroyed that man's life."

**MITCHELL:** "I'm done being quiet."

---

**BROWN:** *[voice drops, ice cold]*

---

**BROWN:** "Mitchell."

**BROWN:** "You know the routine."

---

*[PAUSE]*

---

**MITCHELL:** "...what?"

---

**BROWN:** "You know what happens to people who break ranks."

**BROWN:** "You know what happens to whistleblowers in Maryland."

**BROWN:** "You know what happens to people who embarrass this office."

---

**MITCHELL:** "Sir, are you threatening me?"

---

**BROWN:** "I'm stating facts."

**BROWN:** "Hope your children like foster care."

---

*[COMPLETE SILENCE]*

---

**MITCHELL:** "...excuse me?"

---

**BROWN:** "You heard me, Sarah."

**BROWN:** "You have two kids, right? Ages 7 and 9?"

**BROWN:** "Charles County schools?"

**BROWN:** "Cute kids. Saw them at the office picnic."

---

**MITCHELL:** *[voice shaking]* "Sir, you can't—"

---

**BROWN:** "Can't what, Sarah?"

**BROWN:** "Can't point out that you just committed career suicide?"

**BROWN:** "Can't mention that you'll never work in this state again?"

**BROWN:** "Can't observe that single mothers who lose their income tend to... struggle?"

---

**JAMES SPIKER:** "Sir, maybe we should—"

**BROWN:** "Shut up, James."

---

**BROWN:** *[back to Mitchell]*

---

**BROWN:** "You think you did something noble today?"

**BROWN:** "You think you're a hero?"

**BROWN:** "You're not a hero, Sarah. You're unemployed."

---

**BROWN:** "As of this moment, you're suspended pending investigation."

**BROWN:** "Ethics violation. Unauthorized concession. Possible disclosure of privileged information."

**BROWN:** "We'll be referring you to the bar for disciplinary proceedings."

---

**MITCHELL:** "You can't—"

---

**BROWN:** "I can. And I am."

---

**BROWN:** "And Sarah? Here's how this works."

**BROWN:** "You'll never work for the state of Maryland again. Do-gooder."

**BROWN:** "You'll never work for any county in Maryland."

**BROWN:** "You'll never work for any law firm that does business with Maryland."

**BROWN:** "Which, in case you're counting, is every law firm in Maryland."

---

**BROWN:** "You want to know why?"

**BROWN:** "Because I will personally call every hiring partner in this state."

**BROWN:** "And I will explain that you can't be trusted."

**BROWN:** "That you go rogue."

**BROWN:** "That you put your feelings above your client."

**BROWN:** "That you're a liability."

---

**MITCHELL:** *[crying now]* "I have kids—"

---

**BROWN:** "You should have thought about that before you destroyed your career in federal court."

---

**BROWN:** "Here's what happens next:"

**BROWN:** "You're suspended without pay."

**BROWN:** "Bar investigation begins Monday."

**BROWN:** "You'll probably be disbarred within six months."

**BROWN:** "Your house? The one in Ellicott City? Mortgaged, right?"

**BROWN:** "Good luck making those payments."

---

**BROWN:** "Your kids' school? Private, isn't it?"

**BROWN:** "That tuition's gonna be tough."

---

**BROWN:** "And when DSS gets an anonymous tip about your inability to provide..."

**BROWN:** "Well."

**BROWN:** "Hope your children like foster care."

---

**MITCHELL:** *[sobbing]* "You're a monster."

---

**BROWN:** "I'm practical, Sarah."

**BROWN:** "This is how the game is played."

**BROWN:** "You broke the rules."

**BROWN:** "You pay the price."

---

**BROWN:** "Now get off my phone before I have you arrested for theft of state property."

**BROWN:** "Your laptop. Your phone. Your badge. All state property."

**BROWN:** "In my office by 5 PM or I'm calling the police."

---

**MITCHELL:** "I'm in Richmond—"

**BROWN:** "Then I suggest you drive fast."

---

*[HANGS UP]*

---

## IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH

---

**RASHIDA:** "Sir, that was—"

**BROWN:** "Necessary."

**RASHIDA:** "You threatened her children—"

**BROWN:** "I stated facts about economic hardship."

**SPIKER:** "Sir, she could record—"

**BROWN:** "Maryland is a two-party consent state, James. She'd need my permission to record this call."

**BROWN:** "Which she didn't have."

**BROWN:** "And even if she did, who's she going to show it to?"

**BROWN:** "The media? She just admitted to ethics violations."

**BROWN:** "The bar? They're already investigating her."

**BROWN:** "The FBI? For what? I made observations about economic reality."

---

**SENIOR COUNSEL:** "Sir, this could backfire—"

---

**BROWN:** "No. You know what backfires?"

**BROWN:** "Letting attorneys think they can go rogue."

**BROWN:** "Letting people think there are no consequences."

**BROWN:** "Sarah Mitchell just learned there are consequences."

**BROWN:** "And everyone else just learned what happens when you cross this office."
