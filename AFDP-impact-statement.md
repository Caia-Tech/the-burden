AI systems are being deployed into society faster than we can trust or verify them. AFDP is built to fix that.

## üî¨ What Is AFDP?

AFDP ‚Äî the **AI-Ready Forensic Deployment Pipeline** ‚Äî is an advanced infrastructure framework that provides **audit-grade traceability**, **regulatory compliance automation**, and **evidence-quality data integrity** for AI system deployment and operation.

It combines:

- **Cryptographic audit trails** with Git-based forensic logging
- **Durable workflow orchestration** via Temporal
- **Immutable evidence chains** for regulatory compliance
- **Distributed microservice architecture** with built-in integrity verification
- **Anomaly detection** and tamper-evidence capabilities
- **Chain-of-custody automation** for sensitive data pipelines

AFDP addresses the critical gap in **trustworthy AI deployment** ‚Äî especially in regulated environments requiring:

- Healthcare data processing (HIPAA compliance)
- Financial services AI (SOX, PCI DSS)
- Government and defense applications
- Legal technology and e-discovery systems
- Research data integrity and reproducibility
- Critical infrastructure and safety systems

## üìä The Hidden Risks of AI Deployment ‚Äî and Why Compliance Matters

Current AI deployment practices create significant risks:

- **Regulatory exposure**: AI systems deployed without proper audit trails face compliance violations
- **Data integrity gaps**: Training data provenance is often undocumented or unverifiable  
- **Operational risk**: Deployment failures lack forensic analysis capabilities
- **Research reproducibility**: Scientific AI lacks proper version control and validation
- **Legal vulnerability**: AI decisions cannot be properly defended in court without evidence-grade documentation

AFDP provides the missing infrastructure layer for **trustworthy, auditable AI deployment**.
