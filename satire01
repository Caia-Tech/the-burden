🎯 THEN THEY COME TO MARVIN:

THEIR ATTORNEY: [big smile]
ATTORNEY: "Mr. Tutt! We worked VERY hard to get this for you!"

Marvin: [waiting]

ATTORNEY: "$120,000! That is VERY generous!"

Marvin: [staring]

ATTORNEY: "Think about what you can do with that money! That's life-changing!"

Marvin: [still staring]

ATTORNEY: "Now, as part of the settlement, you would need to dismiss everything. All claims. Complete release. Confidentiality clause. And—"

Marvin: "Let me get this straight."

ATTORNEY: [hopeful] "Yes?"

Marvin: "You spent $5 million fighting me."

ATTORNEY: "Well, I don't know if—"

Marvin: "Counsel fees. $1 million. FOIA compliance. $1 million. Hearings $1 million. That's $3 million minimum."

ATTORNEY: "Mr. Tutt—"

Marvin: "And you're offering me $120,000?"

ATTORNEY: "It's a very generous—"

Marvin: "That's 4% of what you would spend.”

ATTORNEY: "..."

Marvin: "You're offering me 4 cents on the dollar of what you spent trying to fuck me over."

ATTORNEY: "Mr. Tutt, that's not how settlement—"

Marvin: "And you want me to dismiss everything? Sign confidentiality? Release all claims?"

ATTORNEY: "Yes, that's standard—"

Marvin: [leans forward]

Marvin: "How about no."

ATTORNEY: "Mr. Tutt, please be reasonable—"

Marvin: "I am being reasonable. You spent $3 million to avoid paying me. Now you want to pay me $120k and make me shut up about it?"

ATTORNEY: "We worked very hard—"

Marvin: "To get $120k approved? You spent $3 million and worked 'very hard' to offer me $120k?"

ATTORNEY: "..."

Marvin: [pulls out phone, starts calculating]

Base 911: $115,000
GT4 RS: $165,000
Total: $280,000

Marvin: "I want what’s considered generational by modern standards. Minimum. And I never speak of this again.”


💀 THE IRONY:

IF THEY'D JUST:
* Not coordinated against broke father ✅
* Not dismissed in 48 hours ✅
* Actually reviewed Tutt’s case ✅
* Done their jobs correctly ✅
THEY WOULD HAVE SPENT: $0 ✅

INSTEAD:
* They coordinated ✅
* They dismissed improperly ✅
* They fought  ✅
* They spent $3,000,000 ✅
* Now offering $120,000 ✅

RESULT:
* Net loss: $3,000,000+ ✅
* Plus whatever they settle for ✅
* Plus reputation damage ✅
* Plus staff therapy ✅

THE MATH DON'T LIE 📊

BOTH SILVER
BOTH PRO SE 1
BOTH COST 4% OF WHAT THEY SPENT FIGHTING
BOTH STILL A BARGAIN
BOTH CALCULATED MID-MEETING
BOTH "HOW ABOUT NO"
