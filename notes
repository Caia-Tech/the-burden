# Legal Arguments - Case 8:25-cv-02006-TDC

## Federal Rule and Statutory Violations

### Rule 4(c)(3) Violation - Mandatory U.S. Marshal Service
- **Rule Text:** "the court MUST order that service be made by a United States marshal" for IFP plaintiffs
- **What Happened:** Judge Chuang's CMO (ECF 12) required plaintiff to serve within 3 days
- **Legal Effect:** "Must" is mandatory, not discretionary. Direct violation of federal rule.

### 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a) Violation - Prepayment of Fees
- **Statute:** IFP plaintiffs proceed "without prepayment of fees or security"
- **Chuang Required:** Bound volumes, tabbed exhibits, conference attendance
- **Cost Imposed:** Printing, binding, travel, materials
- **Legal Effect:** Any cost = prepayment = statutory violation

### 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B) Contradiction
- **Law:** Courts MUST dismiss frivolous cases "at any time"
- **Timeline Proves Non-Frivolous:**
  - June 23: Case filed
  - July 8: Elaborate Case Management Order issued
  - July 24: Suddenly declared "frivolous"
- **Logic:** Cannot spend resources managing a "frivolous" case for weeks

### Local Rule 105.5 Override
- **Rule:** Exempts pro se parties from binding requirements
- **CMO Page 5:** "Notwithstanding Local Rule 105.5, all exhibits shall be bound"
- **Legal Problem:** Judge cannot override rules protecting indigent litigants
- **Authority Exceeded:** Ultra vires act

## Constitutional Violations

### Equal Protection - Class-Based Discrimination
- **Protected Class:** Indigent pro se plaintiffs
- **Discriminatory Treatment:**
  - Prisoners exempt from requirements (CMO Exception 7)
  - Indigent free citizens must comply
  - Wealthy litigants use attorneys for service
  - Poor must personally serve despite Rule 4(c)(3)
- **Precedent Violated:** Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12 (1956)

### Due Process - Retroactive Destruction Without Authority
- **Attempted Action:** Retroactive destruction of properly filed documents
- **Federal Rules Allowing This:** NONE
- **Available Procedures:**
  - Rule 11 sanctions (requires notice/hearing)
  - Sealing (requires cause showing)
  - Expungement (criminal only)
- **Violation:** Destroying evidence without legal mechanism = due process violation

### Access to Courts - Bounds v. Smith
- **Right:** Meaningful access to courts
- **Barriers Created:**
  - Financial (binding, printing, travel)
  - Procedural (3-day service on multiple defendants)
  - Geographic (conference attendance with suspended license)
  - Practical (cooperation requirement with hostile defendants)
- **Effect:** Constructive denial of court access

## Timeline Proving Consciousness of Guilt

### If Case Was Actually Frivolous:
- June 23: Should have been dismissed immediately under § 1915(e)(2)(B)
- July 8: Would not receive 6-page Case Management Order
- July 15: Judge would not flee when sued
- July 22: No emergency reassignment needed
- July 24: No 48-hour rush dismissal required

### What Actually Happened:
- June 23: Case filed
- June 24: DOJ sues all Maryland federal judges (NEXT DAY)
- July 8: Chuang issues elaborate procedural requirements
- July 15: Plaintiff sues Chuang for $1 nominal damages
- July 22: Chuang flees case (7 days after being sued)
- July 24: Chasanow dismisses in 48 hours
- August 12: Court refuses to answer Rule 52 questions

### Legal Doctrine:
- **Consciousness of Guilt:** Actions inconsistent with innocence are evidence
- **Citation:** United States v. Myers, 550 F.2d 1036 (5th Cir. 1977)
- **Application:** Fleeing + rushing + destroying = guilt consciousness

## Mathematically Impossible Compliance Requirements

### The Service Impossibility
- **Requirement:** Serve all defendants within 3 days
- **Defendants:** 8+ across Maryland
- **Plaintiff Assets:** $141.37 total
- **Cost per Service:** ~$10-50 each
- **Math:** $141 < $80-400 needed
- **With suspended license:** Physically impossible

### The Cooperation Impossibility
- **CMO Requirement:** "All parties shall cooperate to compile joint statement"
- **Reality:** Defendants accused of federal crimes won't cooperate
- **Logic Error:** Cannot jointly agree to criminal wrongdoing
- **Trap:** Non-compliance appears as plaintiff's failure

### The Conference Attendance Impossibility
- **Requirement:** Personal attendance at every pre-motion conference
- **Reality:** 
  - No transportation (suspended license)
  - No funds for travel
  - Multiple conferences = multiple trips
  - Defendants send lawyers, plaintiff must appear personally

## Judicial Estoppel Violation

### Legal Standard
- **Rule:** Party cannot take inconsistent positions for advantage
- **Case:** New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742 (2001)
- **Applies to:** Courts and parties equally

### Position 1 (July 8): "This case requires elaborate management"
- 6-page Case Management Order
- Detailed procedures
- Joint record requirements
- Conference scheduling
- Treating as serious federal litigation

### Position 2 (July 24): "This case was always frivolous"
- No merit
- Should be dismissed
- Sanctions threatened
- Claiming waste of resources

### The Estoppel Problem:
- Cannot claim case always frivolous after treating as legitimate
- Cannot retroactively undo position 1 to support position 2
- Bad faith = taking inconsistent positions for advantage

## Evidence of Multi-Jurisdictional Coordination

### The Silence Pattern (Documented)
- Maryland DSS: No FOIA response
- Maryland AG: Refuses investigation  
- Charles County: Complete silence
- Virginia agencies: Simultaneous non-response
- Federal agencies: Coordinated no-contact

### Statistical Impossibility of Random Occurrence
- Probability of independent simultaneous silence: ~0%
- Only explanation: Coordination
- Legal implication: Conspiracy to deny rights

### Technical Surveillance Evidence
- US Courts ASN: Monitoring "frivolous" dismissed case
- Foreign proxies: Ireland, France, Germany
- Chinese networks: Tencent (twice)
- Anonymous services: SABOTAGE LLC (Amsterdam)
- Timeline: Started June 23 (day of filing)

### The Continuing Surveillance Problem
- Case dismissed July 24
- Monitoring continues through August
- Question: Why monitor a "frivolous" dismissed case?
- Only answer: It's not actually frivolous

## Misapplication of Judicial Immunity - Pulliam v. Allen

### Supreme Court Law - Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U.S. 522 (1984)
- **Holding:** Judicial immunity does NOT bar prospective injunctive relief
- **Plaintiff Sought:** $1 nominal damages + prospective relief
- **Court's Error:** Dismissed based on immunity that doesn't apply

### The $1 Nominal Damages Distinction
- **Purpose:** Establish standing for injunctive relief
- **Not:** Actual damages triggering immunity
- **Precedent:** Standard practice in civil rights litigation
- **Court's Mischaracterization:** Treated as damages claim

### Judge Chuang's Flight
- **If immune:** Would stay on case and assert immunity
- **What happened:** Fled 7 days after being sued
- **Implication:** Consciousness of exposure to liability

## Case Law Misrepresentation

### Doe v. Doe, 660 F.2d 101 (4th Cir. 1981)
- **Court's Claim:** "purely custodial case between private parties"
- **Actual Case:** Federal habeas corpus challenging Virginia adoption on constitutional grounds
- **Plaintiff's Claims:** Due process violations, discrimination based on sexual orientation
- **Significance:** Court mischaracterized constitutional case to justify dismissal

### The Pattern of Misrepresentation
- Misquoted case holdings
- Ignored binding precedent (Pulliam)
- Cited non-binding district court over Supreme Court
- Created false impression of law

## The Impossible Paradox

### The Prosecution Question
- **If claims are frivolous: Filing false claims against federal judges = federal crime
- **18 U.S.C. § 1001:** False statements
- **18 U.S.C. § 1621:** Perjury (verified complaint)
- **Reality:** No prosecution
- **Only explanations:**
  1. Claims have merit
  2. Evidence supports plaintiff
  3. Prosecution would require discovery they want to avoid


### The Resource Allocation Problem
- **Resources spent:** Multiple judges, agencies, surveillance
- **To collect:** $138/week garnishment
- **From:** Unemployed person
- **Logic failure:** Spending more to defend than cost to rectify
- **Only explanation:** Protecting something bigger

## Summary of SOME Reversible Errors. I didn't think it would come to this. I considered it, but never believed they'd actually go for it.

1. Violation of Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(c)(3) - mandatory marshal service
2. Violation of 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a) - prepayment of fees
3. Violation of equal protection - discriminatory treatment
4. Violation of due process - retroactive destruction without authority
5. Violation of court access - Bounds v. Smith
6. Judicial estoppel - inconsistent positions
7. Ultra vires acts - exceeding judicial authority
8. Misapplication of judicial immunity - Pulliam v. Allen
9. Misrepresentation of case law - Doe v. Doe
10. Failure to immediately dismiss if frivolous - § 1915(e)(2)(B)

## The Bottom Line

They're trying to retroactively destroy evidence in a "frivolous" case because it's NOT frivolous - it's dangerous to them. The law doesn't permit retroactive destruction of properly filed documents. Their attempt to do so is itself evidence of the merit of the claims.

This is a pointless fight against one indigent father. Spending time and resources escalating against someone who files at very little cost.

You can pretend it doesn't exist, but actions don't lie. Coordinating silence costs money. Continuing, would mean incurring costs that make the truth impossible to hide. But dismissal is way worse.

"Charles County Child Support Administration, et al. vs. Marvin Tutt"  DOES NOT LOOK LIKE "EX REL". Unless case dockets are wrong.

Judge Chasanow said it's ex rel. How? where did this info come from? case number  	C-08-FM-22-000821

  - Power without accountability
  - The right to lie with impunity

Judicial immunity from damages for actions taken in their role is extremely important. It is REQUIRED in our system. The problem is when it's used as an excuse for injunctive relief! And used
to defend actions taken OUTSIDE of the judicial role!




update, the following are lines from my initial filing. This is what they refuse to address. That filing attacks fraud and protects Americans. So it had to be quelled by any means necessary. Definition of Orwellion. Do you think I want to be a hero? A crusader? the answer is, absolutely not. And it was evident through my filings since day one.

41. Yet I can forgive. I can sit across from those who nearly destroyed me and seek resolution. My compensation need not be solely monetary. Injunctive relief, systemic reforms, acknowledgment of wrongdoing, assurances this will never happen again—these have value beyond dollars. I seek to be made whole in every sense, not merely enriched.

42. Perhaps most surprisingly, this cruelty has deepened my compassion. I don't seek vengeance. I wouldn't wish this experience on my worst enemy—not even on those who inflicted it upon me. The profound isolation of fighting your own government while believing yourself broken is a suffering I want to ensure no one else endures. My goal isn't to punish but to prevent. Not to destroy but to heal. Not just to be compensated but to help fix the very systems that broke me.

43. I will live with this knowledge every day. My son will grow up knowing his father was targeted by the very systems meant to protect us. My family will forever distrust institutions. This generational damage, this permanent alteration of our relationship with our own government, cannot be undone.

44. The amount sought reflects not a single injury but an ongoing transformation of existence itself. When magistrates commit fraud from the bench, when those presiding over family courts violate their duties, they steal more than money or time—they steal the basic trust upon which society depends.

45. The medical records will show the physical manifestations. The court documents will prove the fraud. But no record can capture what it means to discover that those presiding over your case—magistrates sworn to impartiality—were actually conspirators in your destruction. To endure this while fighting through a pandemic, while the mother of your child joins your persecutors, while watching every relationship crumble under the weight of impossible demands—this is a human experience perhaps unique in its cruelty. That reality, now permanent, is what $1.2 billion represents.

I still have respect for the people serving, not just the constitution and leaders who came before us. The problem is, they are part of networks that they must defend. They think they don't have other options.
Many of them believe they are fighting for what's right, which is not up to my discretion. Right or wrong, the first amendment is the first amendment. How they feel is their prerogative.
I don't seek to burn them. I tried every civil and administrative route. I have become indignant at times, they robbed me of my education. Of my federal contract position. And I told them on day one that I could forgive.
Forgiveness is not something that every understands. Some only understand and respect power. Power is something I never wanted to have.

I have directly challenged some personally, but only in response to their escalation. Unfortunately, there are people who think others can't read. Whether 27 year old indigent citizen, executive branch of USA, or judicial.
The malignant patterns documented in my story are not surprising. They happen to use every day. By people we trust.

I respect their authority, their hard work, and their American rights. What I can not respect is unconstitutional coordination, but that is not THEM. I'm not perfect, but I will do my best for 
the American people. I am proud of the ones before us who wrote laws and died for our rights. We fight because we must. Because nobody else will. All of us didn't ask for this but there is vigor 
in us that can not bend to injustice. I'm not thinking of myself, I'm thinking of the unheard fathers who harmed themselves because they saw no other way. The mothers tasked with impossible orders. The children
of the future. Children must know that they can be the change. When I fight for these children, I stake my name, my livelihood, my safety, essentially everything. When they "fight" for children, they do it 
for kickbacks.

Any objective analysis would show exactly what needs to be done. Escalation is the worst possible thing. This could have been quelled in 2022 with one review hearing.
