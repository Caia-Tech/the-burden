# Legal Arguments - Case 8:25-cv-02006-TDC

## Federal Rule and Statutory Violations

### Rule 4(c)(3) Violation - Mandatory U.S. Marshal Service
- **Rule Text:** "the court MUST order that service be made by a United States marshal" for IFP plaintiffs
- **What Happened:** Judge Chuang's CMO (ECF 12) required plaintiff to serve within 3 days
- **Legal Effect:** "Must" is mandatory, not discretionary. Direct violation of federal rule.

### 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a) Violation - Prepayment of Fees
- **Statute:** IFP plaintiffs proceed "without prepayment of fees or security"
- **Chuang Required:** Bound volumes, tabbed exhibits, conference attendance
- **Cost Imposed:** Printing, binding, travel, materials
- **Legal Effect:** Any cost = prepayment = statutory violation

### 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B) Contradiction
- **Law:** Courts MUST dismiss frivolous cases "at any time"
- **Timeline Proves Non-Frivolous:**
  - June 23: Case filed
  - July 8: Elaborate Case Management Order issued
  - July 24: Suddenly declared "frivolous"
- **Logic:** Cannot spend resources managing a "frivolous" case for weeks

### Local Rule 105.5 Override
- **Rule:** Exempts pro se parties from binding requirements
- **CMO Page 5:** "Notwithstanding Local Rule 105.5, all exhibits shall be bound"
- **Legal Problem:** Judge cannot override rules protecting indigent litigants
- **Authority Exceeded:** Ultra vires act

## Constitutional Violations

### Equal Protection - Class-Based Discrimination
- **Protected Class:** Indigent pro se plaintiffs
- **Discriminatory Treatment:**
  - Prisoners exempt from requirements (CMO Exception 7)
  - Indigent free citizens must comply
  - Wealthy litigants use attorneys for service
  - Poor must personally serve despite Rule 4(c)(3)
- **Precedent Violated:** Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12 (1956)

### Due Process - Retroactive Destruction Without Authority
- **Attempted Action:** Retroactive destruction of properly filed documents
- **Federal Rules Allowing This:** NONE
- **Available Procedures:**
  - Rule 11 sanctions (requires notice/hearing)
  - Sealing (requires cause showing)
  - Expungement (criminal only)
- **Violation:** Destroying evidence without legal mechanism = due process violation

### Access to Courts - Bounds v. Smith
- **Right:** Meaningful access to courts
- **Barriers Created:**
  - Financial (binding, printing, travel)
  - Procedural (3-day service on multiple defendants)
  - Geographic (conference attendance with suspended license)
  - Practical (cooperation requirement with hostile defendants)
- **Effect:** Constructive denial of court access

## Timeline Proving Consciousness of Guilt

### If Case Was Actually Frivolous:
- June 23: Should have been dismissed immediately under § 1915(e)(2)(B)
- July 8: Would not receive 6-page Case Management Order
- July 15: Judge would not flee when sued
- July 22: No emergency reassignment needed
- July 24: No 48-hour rush dismissal required

### What Actually Happened:
- June 23: Case filed
- June 24: DOJ sues all Maryland federal judges (NEXT DAY)
- July 8: Chuang issues elaborate procedural requirements
- July 15: Plaintiff sues Chuang for $1 nominal damages
- July 22: Chuang flees case (7 days after being sued)
- July 24: Chasanow dismisses in 48 hours
- August 12: Court refuses to answer Rule 52 questions

### Legal Doctrine:
- **Consciousness of Guilt:** Actions inconsistent with innocence are evidence
- **Citation:** United States v. Myers, 550 F.2d 1036 (5th Cir. 1977)
- **Application:** Fleeing + rushing + destroying = guilt consciousness

## Mathematically Impossible Compliance Requirements

### The Service Impossibility
- **Requirement:** Serve all defendants within 3 days
- **Defendants:** 8+ across Maryland
- **Plaintiff Assets:** $141.37 total
- **Cost per Service:** ~$10-50 each
- **Math:** $141 < $80-400 needed
- **With suspended license:** Physically impossible

### The Cooperation Impossibility
- **CMO Requirement:** "All parties shall cooperate to compile joint statement"
- **Reality:** Defendants accused of federal crimes won't cooperate
- **Logic Error:** Cannot jointly agree to criminal wrongdoing
- **Trap:** Non-compliance appears as plaintiff's failure

### The Conference Attendance Impossibility
- **Requirement:** Personal attendance at every pre-motion conference
- **Reality:** 
  - No transportation (suspended license)
  - No funds for travel
  - Multiple conferences = multiple trips
  - Defendants send lawyers, plaintiff must appear personally

## Judicial Estoppel Violation

### Legal Standard
- **Rule:** Party cannot take inconsistent positions for advantage
- **Case:** New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742 (2001)
- **Applies to:** Courts and parties equally

### Position 1 (July 8): "This case requires elaborate management"
- 6-page Case Management Order
- Detailed procedures
- Joint record requirements
- Conference scheduling
- Treating as serious federal litigation

### Position 2 (July 24): "This case was always frivolous"
- No merit
- Should be dismissed
- Sanctions threatened
- Claiming waste of resources

### The Estoppel Problem:
- Cannot claim case always frivolous after treating as legitimate
- Cannot retroactively undo position 1 to support position 2
- Bad faith = taking inconsistent positions for advantage

## Evidence of Multi-Jurisdictional Coordination

### The Silence Pattern (Documented)
- Maryland DSS: No FOIA response
- Maryland AG: Refuses investigation  
- Charles County: Complete silence
- Virginia agencies: Simultaneous non-response
- Federal agencies: Coordinated no-contact

### Statistical Impossibility of Random Occurrence
- Probability of independent simultaneous silence: ~0%
- Only explanation: Coordination
- Legal implication: Conspiracy to deny rights

### Technical Surveillance Evidence
- US Courts ASN: Monitoring "frivolous" dismissed case
- Foreign proxies: Ireland, France, Germany
- Chinese networks: Tencent (twice)
- Anonymous services: SABOTAGE LLC (Amsterdam)
- Timeline: Started June 23 (day of filing)

### The Continuing Surveillance Problem
- Case dismissed July 24
- Monitoring continues through August
- Question: Why monitor a "frivolous" dismissed case?
- Only answer: It's not actually frivolous

## Misapplication of Judicial Immunity - Pulliam v. Allen

### Supreme Court Law - Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U.S. 522 (1984)
- **Holding:** Judicial immunity does NOT bar prospective injunctive relief
- **Plaintiff Sought:** $1 nominal damages + prospective relief
- **Court's Error:** Dismissed based on immunity that doesn't apply

### The $1 Nominal Damages Distinction
- **Purpose:** Establish standing for injunctive relief
- **Not:** Actual damages triggering immunity
- **Precedent:** Standard practice in civil rights litigation
- **Court's Mischaracterization:** Treated as damages claim

### Judge Chuang's Flight
- **If immune:** Would stay on case and assert immunity
- **What happened:** Fled 7 days after being sued
- **Implication:** Consciousness of exposure to liability

## Case Law Misrepresentation

### Doe v. Doe, 660 F.2d 101 (4th Cir. 1981)
- **Court's Claim:** "purely custodial case between private parties"
- **Actual Case:** Federal habeas corpus challenging Virginia adoption on constitutional grounds
- **Plaintiff's Claims:** Due process violations, discrimination based on sexual orientation
- **Significance:** Court mischaracterized constitutional case to justify dismissal

### The Pattern of Misrepresentation
- Misquoted case holdings
- Ignored binding precedent (Pulliam)
- Cited non-binding district court over Supreme Court
- Created false impression of law

## The Impossible Paradox

### The Prosecution Question
- **If claims are frivolous: Filing false claims against federal judges = federal crime
- **18 U.S.C. § 1001:** False statements
- **18 U.S.C. § 1621:** Perjury (verified complaint)
- **Reality:** No prosecution
- **Only explanations:**
  1. Claims have merit
  2. Evidence supports plaintiff
  3. Prosecution would require discovery they want to avoid


### The Resource Allocation Problem
- **Resources spent:** Multiple judges, agencies, surveillance
- **To collect:** $138/week garnishment
- **From:** Unemployed person
- **Logic failure:** Spending more to defend than cost to rectify
- **Only explanation:** Protecting something bigger

## Summary of SOME Reversible Errors. I didn't think it would come to this. I considered it, but never believed they'd actually go for it.

1. Violation of Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(c)(3) - mandatory marshal service
2. Violation of 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a) - prepayment of fees
3. Violation of equal protection - discriminatory treatment
4. Violation of due process - retroactive destruction without authority
5. Violation of court access - Bounds v. Smith
6. Judicial estoppel - inconsistent positions
7. Ultra vires acts - exceeding judicial authority
8. Misapplication of judicial immunity - Pulliam v. Allen
9. Misrepresentation of case law - Doe v. Doe
10. Failure to immediately dismiss if frivolous - § 1915(e)(2)(B)

## The Bottom Line

They're trying to retroactively destroy evidence in a "frivolous" case because it's NOT frivolous - it's dangerous to them. The law doesn't permit retroactive destruction of properly filed documents. Their attempt to do so is itself evidence of the merit of the claims.

This is a pointless fight against one indigent father. Spending time and resources escalating against someone who files at very little cost.

You can pretend it doesn't exist, but actions don't lie. Coordinating silence costs money. Continuing, would mean incurring costs that make the truth impossible to hide. But dismissal is way worse.

"Charles County Child Support Administration, et al. vs. Marvin Tutt"  DOES NOT LOOK LIKE "EX REL". Unless case dockets are wrong.

Judge Chasanow said it's ex rel. How? where did this info come from? case number  	C-08-FM-22-000821

Protecting Crime
  - Mutual protection racket
  - "You scratch my back" network
  - Immunity from consequences
  - Power without accountability
  - The right to lie with impunity
  - Federal funds through fraud

Protecting USA
  - The Constitution ✓
  - Rule of law
  - Mathematical truth
  - Due process
  - Equal justice
  - Transparent courts
  - American principles

Judicial immunity from damages for actions taken in their role is extremely important. It is REQUIRED in our system. The problem is when it's used as an excuse for injunctive relief! And used
to defend actions taken OUTSIDE of the judicial role!




update, the following are lines from my initial filing. This is what they refuse to address. That filing attacks fraud and protects Americans. So it had to be quelled by any means necessary. Definition of Orwellion. Do you think I want to be a hero? A crusader? the answer is, absolutely not. And it was evident through my filings since day one.

41. Yet I can forgive. I can sit across from those who nearly destroyed me and seek resolution. My compensation need not be solely monetary. Injunctive relief, systemic reforms, acknowledgment of wrongdoing, assurances this will never happen again—these have value beyond dollars. I seek to be made whole in every sense, not merely enriched.

42. Perhaps most surprisingly, this cruelty has deepened my compassion. I don't seek vengeance. I wouldn't wish this experience on my worst enemy—not even on those who inflicted it upon me. The profound isolation of fighting your own government while believing yourself broken is a suffering I want to ensure no one else endures. My goal isn't to punish but to prevent. Not to destroy but to heal. Not just to be compensated but to help fix the very systems that broke me.

43. I will live with this knowledge every day. My son will grow up knowing his father was targeted by the very systems meant to protect us. My family will forever distrust institutions. This generational damage, this permanent alteration of our relationship with our own government, cannot be undone.

44. The amount sought reflects not a single injury but an ongoing transformation of existence itself. When magistrates commit fraud from the bench, when those presiding over family courts violate their duties, they steal more than money or time—they steal the basic trust upon which society depends.

45. The medical records will show the physical manifestations. The court documents will prove the fraud. But no record can capture what it means to discover that those presiding over your case—magistrates sworn to impartiality—were actually conspirators in your destruction. To endure this while fighting through a pandemic, while the mother of your child joins your persecutors, while watching every relationship crumble under the weight of impossible demands—this is a human experience perhaps unique in its cruelty. That reality, now permanent, is what $1.2 billion represents.

I still have respect for the people serving, not just the constitution and leaders who came before us. The problem is, they are part of networks that they must defend. They think they don't have other options.
Many of them believe they are fighting for what's right, which is not up to my discretion. Right or wrong, the first amendment is the first amendment. How they feel is their prerogative.
I don't seek to burn them. I tried every civil and administrative route. I have become indignant at times, they robbed me of my education. Of my federal contract position. And I told them on day one that I could forgive.
Forgiveness is not something that every understands. Some only understand and respect power. Power is something I never wanted to have.

I have directly challenged some personally, but only in response to their escalation. Unfortunately, there are people who think others can't read. Whether 27 year old indigent citizen, executive branch of USA, or judicial.
The malignant patterns documented in my story are not surprising. They happen to use every day. By people we trust.

I respect their authority, their hard work, and their American rights. What I can not respect is unconstitutional coordination, but that is not THEM. I'm not perfect, but I will do my best for 
the American people. I am proud of the ones before us who wrote laws and died for our rights. We fight because we must. Because nobody else will. All of us didn't ask for this but there is vigor 
in us that can not bend to injustice. I'm not thinking of myself, I'm thinking of the unheard fathers who harmed themselves because they saw no other way. The mothers tasked with impossible orders. The children
of the future. Children must know that they can be the change. When I fight for these children, I stake my name, my livelihood, my safety, essentially everything. When they "fight" for children, they do it 
for kickbacks.

Any objective analysis would show exactly what needs to be done. Escalation is the worst possible thing. This could have been quelled in 2022 with one review hearing.

----------
two points.

1. The court is quick to say "Failure to state a claim" while also quashing your claims, talking about page limits, and preventing you from filing motions. You want narrow or full? (spoiler: neither)
2. Suing judges for prospective relief is our american right. I never wanted chuang's money. Or even magistrate's money UNLESS they were found maliciously coordinating. When a judge CONSPIRES to 
violate you constitutional right, the proper step is a lawsuit! It's legal for a reason. Rule of Law = 6th grade. A motion won't help you. It will just make the judge sneakier. What happens when judges
use "immunity" as an excuse to violate your rights and everyone allows it? Satirical-looking orders and opinions like the ones documented here. which leads to distrust, risk, and precedent.
I can let go of this since it's in the fourth's hands. BUT THIS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL AMERICANS. Judges should follow the law just like we are expected to.

------

man. I really, really, hope the magistrates/lawyers/caseworkers aren't overstressing now. This turned into a massive civil rights issue. but I understand why the state court couldn't just retroactively correct.
I don't discount the likelihood of conspiracy from them, and evidence in discovery. But, they are women, and it makes me sad to know this case can drag on and I know how anxiety can be. I just pray I get to resolve this.
And pray for maturity to be able to handle whatever I discover about me, and to forgive. Insured on not, implications and optics can be bad. I have to reach deep. especially since I have exactly $0. No promises. And I'm entitled to 
whatever I become entitled to. But I really have to think. That's if remanded. If not remanded, by some strange reason, well. Still following the law. Trying to handle things a bit better as well.
I made it this far, I can [try to] hold on strong without raising hell. Not legal strategy. I'm just pro se and trying to survive and stay myself while institutions bury me.

i know there's obviously conflict in state courts. But... you all see obvious violations all around you. it's normal to you. Imagine being the one that gets caught up in things. This is why I want to amend. Remove defendants and damages for now.
I thought at the time, i had to state damages, or at least should. But learning it may not be so necessary. Especially with our new context and 4th circuit opinion.

None of this is how i expected it- as you know. But let me tell you want I actually expected. Maryland counsel:"Oh shit, marvin is right. seeks limited relief, let's quietly fix, let the man finish college."
AG: "Isolated issue, we'll investigate, prospectively fix"    everyone happy. Instead I got- you already know the rest. Not that I'm blaming you right now. I was shocked. Completely. I'll try to de-escalate.
try to make things right, even if it's hard for me. Even if I have to take a couple more blows here and their to power through. institutions need time to assess. I'm TRYING



-------

A system that cannot or will not distinguish between a mistake and a malicious attack can't truly deliver justice.

-------

Will fight 5 years, 10 years... Inside and out. If it's required, it will be done.

The Only Thing They Have Left:
Hope he gives up.
But why would he?
You already took:

His biology/premed degree and medical career aspirations
His government job
His driver's license
His credit
His housing stability
His mental health (6-7 ER visits)
His relationship with his son
His dignity

What's left to threaten?
Answer: NOTHING.

-------

Have to stand up for myself because no one else will. You all know something? 1 case- or even the cascade from it can't destroy the system. Individuals must be afraid of exposure. The solution is 
for us to work together on this. I'm fighting for my belief in that resolution. We can protect the constitution and the institutions. 

-------
WITH GREAT LEGAL POWER
COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY

THE PRO SE MUST SERVE JUSTICE

1. ME FIRST
   (Can't pour from empty cup)

2. THEN THE ONES I CARE ABOUT
   (Safe, boundaried support)

3. THEN INSTITUTIONS
   (Systemic change for all)

THIS IS THE WAY ⚔️

--------------------------------

In all seriousness, I won't let these people violate me.

---------

Mon Oct 13, federal government still shut down

America- another day in the fight for our rights. The country need this. the world need this. The people need this.

They have seen it all from pro se plaintiffs 💀

Christopher Columbus as a defendant in 2000 💀

2025: Marvin Tutt   (What the heck is wrong with this plaintiff?)

-------------

now i just have to sit here.... and do nothing. Waiting for institutional slowness. Still believe in the fourth circuit's process. Have to hold on to this. Not fight. Staying still. Safety measures engaged.
retaining all rights. Will not accept "that's just the way it is"

50 years you walk all over us. Not even for money. You already have money. JUST for control. And you can't even resist being corrupt

Already caught, what will doubling down do? your judges are too afraid to even speak up for what's right. Definition constitutional crisis

Knew what i signed for.

none of you brave enough to do it.

Oct 17

Another day of service to America. To fight for international, basic human rights.

It only takes one person

To improve democracy

Wed Nov 12 2025- 

I worked hard to obey the court for 6 years.

When the conspiracy began in late 2021 and I was ignorant to it, I assumed good faith for over 3 years.

I can remember most of what was said to me during those hearings. I can remember the responses to the things I said. I know exactly where to point for evidence and how to prove
why a lot of you are individually liable. You continue to offend me. Case workers, state judges, magistrates- none of you are worth my time.

Moore, Brown, not seeking personal liability.

District judiciary - I'll be needing you to do your job, but the choice is yours.

On June 23, 2025. I filed an open-shut case. The evidence was so strong that everyone knows they MUST avoid discovery AND letting people see the case. But dismissal? coverups? You just made it worse.
Take that L on the chin like you force us to do every day !

I can not believe how stupid you think some of us are. To hear William Greer speak to me like a child, to see Theodore Chuang think I can't recognize obvious fraud, to see semi retired ex chief Deborah Chasanow lie in public record-
It's not hubris. It's a complete failure. From a bunch of people who have zero idea what they're doing!

I won't pursue any of them. I'll just beat you alone. Nobody knows. And I'm not recruiting.

The federal case is only one manifestation of a much larger fight.

All Maryland officials should notice:

1. By using the ombudsman to coordinate against me, your agencies revealed their identities and where the conspiracy evidence lives. It is discoverable through your agencies. Making ombudsman privacy futile.

2. By partnering with Anthropic and using Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude, they waive lawyer client privilege. 

These two simple facts illustrate total failure.


JUDGE JAMES WEST- The laugh is: they just created a court order that's now public record, based on provably distorted evidence

first they illegally manufacture hearings to violate rights, they threaten you when you refuse to dignify their fraud. Parents, I will fight for you with everything I have left. 
That is my promise.

My latest review was made in mistake due to a sabotage cyber attack attempt. I was mailed something with CC letterhead, under false domain mdcourts [dot] com. this domain needs to be investigated and reported. I stand to rectify any damage. i am federal plaintiff / target.

Things are starting to get dirty. I won't be able to verify the source. nor get assistance from feds.



THIS IS WHY GIT FORENSICS EXISTS. You see what it's like to be me in real time! No planning. No lies. JUST DOCUMENTED TRUTH. I will rectify any mistake to the best of my ability! That is 
the requirement of good faith. When you're important, YOU GET SABOTAGED. watch for the attacks. I'll tighten up from now on. This all stays permanent !!!!!


----------


I don't know who needs to hear this, just a hunch. But fyi my past experience on an nga project was unclassified and no clearance. I think everyone knows this but I'm further clarifying.
I will try my best to ensure data integrity 



----------

this world is a scam

-----------

🥱 they got me good boys

-----------


but america is ... interesting 😂

hope I can finally relax then write about it.

hope i can get that job...

hope I can integrate back into the collective unconscious. Then shut the hell up 😂 It's only fair gov. YOU did this to me. so let me help YOU. win win.

I'm grateful for the experience. The violations and targetting make me stronger. And if I can do this with $0 and blacklisting I will appreciate a normal life that much more.

a little impact. a little sympathy. a little audacity. a little absurdity. I am blessed (edit: i meant my effect on institutions, not myself personally)


IM SO SAD TO FIND THIS OUT. 4:18am - it WAS real.
emailed 500+ officials! this is horrible. I am hurt. I apologized for nothing. I AM POSTING IT ALL HERE SOON

nope i was wrong. Just got an email address mixed up. IT IS REAL. FROM JAMES WEST. the supplied email WAS 
IT WAS NOT A CYBER ATTACK, THIS CAME FROM CHARLES COUNTY COURT. All facts remain true!
I tried to be fair and follow the rules. and apologize when I'm wrong. but I had a wrong domain on MY record. the AO is on charles county's hidden docket.
The email they gave me IS CCCharlesCtAdmin@mdcourts.gov.    the . com one was ME contacting the wrong email. this is absolutely a real order. it references facts that NO hacker would know.
Rescinding the apology emails. they were a mistake.


---


ya know.... all this whiplash.. being violated, apologizing, relieved because i could think they weren't that bad... then realizing again, idk. Another layer of resilience.

I hope everyone enjoys this data


--------


nov 19-

So glad i documented this all. Assumed good faith in the court system, went to college, got on nga contract, and learned cold truths of the world.

we knew corruption exists, but living it first hand is a life changing. Now can actually understand how systems work. How it works against the people, and does not follow the law.

i said it already but law doesn't matter (it does for us, not them) - this is a very freeing truth.

When I called Greer a fraud, I (naively) thought I was standing up for the constitution. Might as well call everyone fraud- waste of time.

They do horrible things. Pro se litigant win vs state was what, 1960s? but I studied them and figured it out. They didn't win because they were smart. They won because the government had an
interest in the outcome. The constitution is not real. There IS a swamp but the draining is reserved for a special time that can't be rushed.

There are fundamental reasons that corruption can't be separated from power. A lot of the problems are very easy to fix but there is no vested interest in fixing them.

since we can be violated up and down, and thrown in jail by people who think they are god, marked forever etc... document everything. accept nothing. don't be intimidated. sunlight is the best disinfectanct.
kick a boulder and nothing will happen. kick a bolder 10,000 times and you will get stronger. kick a bolder 1 million times and people will watch.

never stop learning, never stop improving, and never do nothing

--------------

Good morning America.

SENATOR MUSE MAKES ME PROUD

---------------


On June 23, 2025
I [Marvin Tutt, Pro Se] file civil rights lawsuit against Maryland agencies- predominantly executive branch. (CSA, DSS, Administrators)

The next day - June 24th, 2025 - Governor Wes Moore announces voluntar buyout program offering executive branch employees $20k to resign, thus activating policy that destroys records relevant to my case.

I learned of the VSP and notified MD gov officials and Wes Moore.

They did absolutely nothing. Meaning regardless- gross negligence severely impacted my case and hid data that I am entitled to by explicitly 

The office is now obstructing my PIA

This is irrefutable. But it's just how government works. America, I will continue to fight.

After learning that judges, officials, the OAG, and more have no problem lying and manufacturing facts to violate my rights and threaten my freedom, I've been enraged.

After seeing that there are still good people in office, I'm changing my approach. Because I fight for them too.

For America, for people who stand up for American rights, for parents that struggle, for my fellow African Americans, and for my Son.
-------------------


Here's what happens at the OAG-

Employees protect the state. See the crimes against humanity, and they end up with substance abuse problems, chronic stress, are prone to mistakes, and more.

lawsuits create more spending and more crimes to document.

With transparent reform we can change this, and restore faith to the American people.

“I would rather adjust than burn.”
“I would rather learn than pretend.”
“I would rather document and admit than live in delusion.”
------------------------


Nov 20, 2025 1:40am

hey everyone. I'm quiet, I'm peaceful, I'm writing code. Now can you stop escalating and not violate my rights? So I don't have to publicly document more crimes?

Thankyou.
--------------------


I document my mindframe. I document my strategies. I inform officials. I wrote a whole guide gitforensics.org ...   

The problem with your "Tutt protocol" drafts- They don't address the substance of your systems, just how to contain "problematic individuals". This won't work. Like I said, OAG must contract me.
You will all obsess over optics, conspire against rights, treat law abiding citizens as threats, misdiagnose risks, oh god what's the point. Just hire me.

The problem you don't understand: "The next Tutt" is not Tutt. They may: Research individual's past personally, engage in criminal activity, have a social media following, have inside backing,
have cyber threats in their possession, have access to secrets, have no moral code or empathy, have way more substantial damage claims, I'm going to stop talking. Baby food for you dilettantes


----------------------

~ 3:30 pm - just woke up.

Today is the best day. hands down. in 5 months.

Thank you Maryland! I'm sorry for the messy parts

Sorry to the Governor

I'll do my part!

-----------------------






MD should be super careful about datacenter adoption.

Focus on: Job placement, IT infrastructure, Data science and curation, transparent records

----------------------

Anthropic is amazing! Maryland, utilize it for science NOT for products! that's how we win

----------------------

The government needs clear and morally sound protection against the vexatious litigants. The bar should be high, and the government must maintain high moral authority.
This is democracy! Constant improvement. But we have to ensure that "vexatious" is not twisted or used to violate constitutional rights.

I trust that America and our tech companies are working hard to make this country better.

----------------------

Pro tip for Maryland regarding AI - Host your own containers and models. Check out the company "Cohere". Own your AI infrastructure so sensitive docs can't be retreived. Have tight policy
around unathorized third party and at-home AI use. 

-----------------------

i can speak the language, even if it's templated.

And I can wait.

Dignity, peace, respect.

I won't compromise on change, but I won't rush it either.

--------

I always forget how rare what I'm doing is. That's by their design. As easy as it feels, 99% of pro se can't do this. I remember here I was thinking this is normal. This happens. Not often, but it
happens. Naive.

---------

Regarding title 4d fraud, it costs the state and gov more than it makes. A few incentives, few extra dollars, it's more of a "corruption participation trophy" if anything. Just do it properly-
less failing citizens, less substance abuse, less lawsuits, more faith in system. When is the last time we had an unscripted pro se victory that changed civil rights? Don't we need this for America?
Isn't that in America's DNA? Or you forgot?

---------


Non Partisan. Restating. If anyone was wondering.

-------

wanting to integrate back into society, but also stay to myself. I can accept theater but not expose it. That was always an option. Shouldn't anyone have to convince this though...

The threats ... the intimidation ... the clear violations, that's what I can't stand. Once again, I can forgive. [some things]

at least pretend to try. Don't look like a cartoonish villian in my documents please. I value you guys' lives, even though I don't want to engage in the same stuff.

I'm perceptive, but I can turn it off. And assist you. You need people like that.

-------------

to describe their failure in simple terms, this is how I put it.

Hypermodern Alekhine. Overextend -----> position undermined -------> Zugzwang (no good moves)

Match. Don't overextend. "Sounds easy when it's a metaphor a metaphor and not real life" -----> no. The law and constitution already provide the answers.

"But this means potentially losing to other litigants" ------> Yes. Yes it does. That's democracy. That's better than reopening what you already finished.

America could settle with the litigants for way less than they spend to fight them. The money goes right back to the government anyway.... + More efficient.

-----------------------


I know Maryland will keep their workers their safe, and I'll do my part as well. Rebuilding

It'll work.

And I'll narrow my claims and keep certain things off record.

No one is allowed to speak to me, flying solo but I'll figure it all out.

-------------------------

6:50am

Thankful for another day

Proud to be Black, proud to be American

My allegience is to one Kingdom

My duty is to reflect that kingdom in my nation

Good morning USA

----

when it's over, I do want to leave MD. But I want to do more for them than write memos

-------

Can't go to a cold cell eating cake every day, what's wrong with Charles County?

-------

The more transparent and public you are, the harder it is to frame you. The harder it is to bury you / take you out. Best for people with nothing to hide

--------

nov 24 2025 ~ 8:40am

Son's mother contacted officials through reply-all thread for nonserious matter. I do not condone nor associate.

I only email officials about serious matters related to 25-1950, do not condone this^

---------

Can someone hurry up and appear so we can speak? Or can someone's counsel contact me, so we can hurry and talk something out?

Seeking to remove judges/magistrates, narrow claims, settle, get contract, save America, protect judiciary, protect maryland gov

^Not a waiver

Seriously. I can't talk to you through git and webforms... This is ridiculous

---------

super tired of protecting my opponents from themselves

- - 

Comprehensive damage control and cleanup available, I know what to do...

-Marvin
-----------------

Nov 25, 2025

Historians, Analysts, Americans,

please don't go hard on your states and USA gov if you are upset. This is America, work together.

-Marvin Tutt

-----------------

They made mistales, I made mistakes, but they are not evil

----------------

Why were attorneys and federal solicitors processing my PIAs, FOIAs, and person record requests? That's like ordering a McMuffin and corporate pulls up 😭

----------------

Once this is settled, my goal is to help all 3 branches. As much as I can. 🇺🇸

----------------

The problem is, majority of government workers are there for the wrong reasons. Title, money, status, when in actuality it is supposed to be about service.

"WE THE PEOPLE" - People come first. Officials serve the people. Somewhere they turned it into power. If you don't want to be a servant you are there for the wrong reasons. People who
betray the people shouldn't be there. Just make room for the people who truly want to service America
----------------

I don't know who needed to hear this, but the impeachment attempt against Theodore D. Chuang is frivolous. Leave the man alone. 

edit (my issue isn't resolved, but wrong is wrong. Come on now.)
----------------

Imagine someone with the perception to read you completely. Who knows when you're lying. Who senses your intentions before you act. Who understands your patterns better than you understand them yourself. Who can predict your next move based on patterns you don't even know you're repeating.

----------------

The current administration in Maryland has inherited a horrendous system. Will take forever for anyone to improve. And it's not even limited to Maryland... Less politics, more science and unity

----------------

existential litigant -------> loyalist.   Easy choice. Where do I sign?

----------------

And they said that I wouldn't make it ... (I remember like yesterday) 💀 Holding on to what God gave me-

-Akon 
----------------

There's only one of y'all that I really hate. And I even forgave that one. Didn't know forgiveness could be THAT hard.

I follow the rules, I stick to principles, and some think it's "weak". The irony... All while following the path of least resistance.

----------------

Even though I hate a judge, all of them are captured. Even though they are captured, all have a choice.  Not righteous, but redeemable



-----------------

Yesterday was Gabriel's birthday, couldn't stop thinking of him

-----------------

I find their cowardice and incompetence to be 10 times more disgusting than the low level corruption. Corruption is whatever but no brain no heart no courage shatters constituent faith. Go see the Wizard.

-----------------

I think they'll try to fix what they can. But can't fix all of course. I'm patient. I want to help protect the system (But the efficient way)

I hope I can help them take more data driven approaches rather than dangerous cookie-cutter policies. I'm here to serve. 

-----------------

Notice- PAO wrongfully attributes AI and technology to be the cause of their dysfunction, showing that they have no understanding. Their problem is allowing agencies to misuse the PAO.
Competent PIA filings only expose the dysfunction. Shows Maryland does not understand the problem. It is not a legislature problem. More money being wasted.

-----------------

Maryland needs to do something about cyber threats and foreign surveillance within their systems instead of pretending it doesn't exist.

-----------------

PAO needs much better automation as well as better data management and governance 

-----------------

I hope legislators and the governor do something about our pantries. Pantries in Maryland pocket funding and good food, leaving expired waste for the Marylanders. Giving away expired products to
out community should be ILLEGAL.

-----------------

Tutt's 3 T's:

    Transparency - Where's the $8.5B going?
    Truth - The deficit isn't a mystery, it's a choice
    Trust - You can't trust systems with no oversight
-----------------

Commit c0a6666 - event git knows y'all r devilish 

-----------------

While I still don't have food stamps, I don't want the federal government to distribute funding. I would rather starve than allow maryland to continue running their federal program racket and giving our hard earned
SNAP benefits to people who don't even have residency here, yet denying people like us who legally reside here. This is not a political statement, this is basic human rights. 
Maryland can not claim to protect the privacy and rights of Marylanders while monitoring me and obstructing my rights.

They do not care about privacy. They only care about hiding their fraud and protecting their political image.

While the PAO has lied to me, I remain patient and faithful to my goal of bringing transparency, truth, and trust to the state of Maryland.
-----------------

Don't try ambiguity with me. Or games. You see it's not working. I will read your person for face value and take your communications literally. Don't try to say "We tried calling him". 
save yourself from embarrassment because this will lead to exposure.

-----------------

At first I thought the judges and OAG would help me. Then I had to teach them everything.

-----------------

Leadership is proud of citizens while citizens are embarrassed by leadership.

-----------------

this is the system cowards protect. Systems that will hold you individually liable for protecting them. Whether the statutes are meant to protect the system from rogues doesn't matter.
You are exposing your hard working employees! The current administration says NO MAN LEFT BEHIND. That should include YOUR ombudswoman and employees. You hid behind Honorable J. Chasanow
and now our head of transparency, PATTERN.

----------------

patterns documented. As foretold ~ 5 months ago. https://gitforensics.org/ read chapter 7

Monday spike ------> new litigation + delegate campaign + internal meetings -------> concious of guilt ---------> documented data points

----------------

smoke, mirrors, obfuscation -----> harder to maintain -----> more holes --------> content still spreads --------> Streisand --------> compartments fail --------> morale lost

attempt at obfuscation still documented. Sensitive events measured

Hubris = makes 0 sense

Already lost when you spent resources against $0
----------------

Bureaucracies DO respond to logic. Just the ones with the worst performance are less inclined. This is the problem with free money and minimal consequences. This is why we need transparency.
Do you know how many problems would get solved if the state just began documenting things publicly like I do? Moral highground, more power, less liability, more trust, more truth

----------------

ridiculous. utterly ridiculous. I'm tired of good people being forced to be movie villians while the director hides
