# Excerpt from The Burden

From Chapter 1: "You Couldn't Help But Wonder"

> You couldn't help it. Your brain collected data points like other kids collected baseball cards. Every interaction filed away, cross-referenced, analyzed for consistency. You weren't trying to be different. You were trying to make sense of why people said one thing but did another.

> "You think too much" became the anthem of your life. As if thinking was something you could just... stop. As if your brain came with an off switch you were too stubborn to flip. As if seeing patterns was a choice rather than a compulsion.
