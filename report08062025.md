Investigation Report: Judicial Misconduct in Tutt v. State of Maryland

  Executive Summary

  This report documents extraordinary judicial misconduct in the federal case Tutt v. State of Maryland 
  et al., Case No. 8:25-cv-02006. The case reveals a pattern of coordinated judicial action to dismiss
  valid federal civil rights claims through procedural manipulation and legal misapplication.

  The most striking aspect of this case is its timeline. A federal judge was sued by the plaintiff,
  removed from the case seven days later without explanation, and replaced by another judge who dismissed
   the entire case in just 48 hours. This sequence of events, combined with the fact that all Maryland
  federal judges are currently defendants in a Department of Justice lawsuit, raises serious questions
  about judicial independence and due process.

  Background

  On June 23, 2025, Marvin Tutt filed a comprehensive federal lawsuit alleging that Maryland state
  agencies conspired to create fraudulent child support obligations. His complaint documented an
  arrangement where a government agency filed as co-plaintiff with a private citizen,
  creating what Tutt described as a "mathematical impossibility" - requiring him to simultaneously work
  full-time to pay support and attend school full-time to complete court-ordered education.

  The very next day, June 24, 2025, the Department of Justice filed litigation against all fifteen
  federal judges in Maryland. That same day, Maryland Governor Wes Moore announced employee buyouts for
  state workers. This remarkable timing suggests coordination or, at minimum, awareness of impending
  federal scrutiny.

  The Discriminatory Case Management Order

  On July 8, 2025, Judge Theodore D. Chuang issued a Case Management Order that created extraordinary
  barriers for the plaintiff. The order required pre-motion conferences for virtually all filings,
  imposed severe page limitations, and most remarkably, included "Exception #7" which exempted prisoner
  cases from these restrictions.

  This created an absurd situation. The court's own docket entry from July 2 confirmed Tutt's status as a
   "Non-Prisoner." Yet six days later, Judge Chuang issued an order that gave prisoners more favorable
  treatment than this free citizen. Incarcerated individuals could file motions freely while Tutt faced
  restriction after restriction.

  The order also required Tutt to create "Joint Records" with the very defendants he accused of fraud.
  This meant collaborating with alleged conspirators to create "Joint Statements of Undisputed Facts" - a
   logical impossibility when the core dispute involves whether fraud occurred.

  The Suspicious Reassignment and Lightning Dismissal

  On July 15, 2025, after enduring a week of these discriminatory procedures, Tutt took an extraordinary
  step. He filed a Second Amended Complaint adding Judge Chuang as a defendant, seeking only one dollar
  in nominal damages to establish the principle that judges cannot discriminate against pro se litigants.

  Seven days later, on July 22, the case was mysteriously reassigned to Judge Deborah K. Chasanow. No
  explanation was provided for this reassignment. Judge Chuang simply vanished from the case.

  What happened next defies normal federal court practice. Within 48 hours, Judge Chasanow produced a
  10-page single-spaced opinion with over 35 case citations, dismissing the entire case. This timeline is
   essentially impossible through normal judicial process.

  The Mathematical Impossibility of the Dismissal Opinion

  Federal judges typically take months to decide complex motions. The process involves reading all
  filings, researching applicable law, drafting opinions, revising, and checking citations. Judge
  Chasanow supposedly completed all of this in two days.

  Consider what she claims to have done in 48 hours:
  - Read and analyzed a 66-page complaint
  - Reviewed over 20 pending motions
  - Examined the Second Amended Complaint
  - Researched Maryland state court records
  - Found and read 35+ federal cases
  - Written 10 pages of legal analysis
  - Formatted everything with proper citations

  The opinion shows signs of being pre-written or assembled from templates. Large sections read like
  boilerplate language. The extensive case citations with pinpoint page references would require days of
  research alone. Either this opinion was prepared in advance, multiple people worked on it
  simultaneously, or artificial intelligence was used to generate portions.

  Legal Misapplications in the Dismissal

  While Judge Chasanow cited real cases, she systematically misapplied them to reach her predetermined
  conclusion.

  The Domestic Relations Exception Fraud

  The court dismissed the case under the "domestic relations exception," which prevents federal courts
  from hearing divorce and custody disputes. But Tutt wasn't seeking divorce or custody determinations.
  After he voluntarily dismissed Regina Robinson (the only private individual), the remaining defendants
  were all government entities:
  - The State of Maryland
  - Charles County Child Support Administration
  - Charles County Department of Social Services
  - Various government officials

  How can someone have a "domestic relationship" with the State of Maryland? The absurdity of this
  reasoning reveals the outcome-driven nature of the dismissal.

  Misuse of Precedent

  The court cited Ankenbrandt v. Richards for the domestic relations exception. Ironically, Ankenbrandt
  actually supports Tutt's position. That case specifically held that federal courts CAN hear federal
  statutory claims like civil rights violations, even when they arise from family disputes. Judge
  Chasanow used a case that contradicts her conclusion.

  Similarly, she invoked Rooker-Feldman doctrine, which prevents federal courts from reviewing state
  court judgments. But Tutt wasn't appealing state court decisions. He was raising independent federal
  claims about ongoing fraud, conspiracy, and constitutional violations. The doctrine simply doesn't
  apply.

  Ignoring Factual Allegations

  Most egregiously, the court declared Tutt's conspiracy claims "completely devoid of factual support"
  despite 66 pages of detailed allegations including:
  - Specific dates and times
  - Email evidence
  - Court transcripts showing perjury
  - Mathematical calculations proving impossibility
  - Documentary evidence of phantom income
  - Timeline correlations with federal investigation

  Under federal pleading standards, courts must accept factual allegations as true when deciding motions
  to dismiss. Judge Chasanow ignored this fundamental rule.

  The Broader Context: Systemic Corruption

  This case cannot be understood in isolation. All fifteen Maryland federal judges are currently
  defendants in DOJ litigation. The governor announced employee buyouts the day after Tutt filed suit,
  suggesting an attempt to remove witnesses. The Maryland Attorney General has refused to investigate
  documented civil rights violations.

  The speed and coordination of the dismissal - from sued judge to reassignment to dismissal in nine days
   - demonstrates institutional protection mechanisms at work. When judges can be sued, removed, and
  replaced with someone who dismisses the case in 48 hours, the appearance of justice is destroyed.

  National Security Implications

  Perhaps most disturbing, Tutt documented that after Maryland's actions against him, Chinese
  intelligence services began targeting him digitally. Cloudflare logs show reconnaissance from
  ALIBABA-CN-NET and TENCENT-NET-AP-CN, along with credential theft attempts through French and
  Australian proxy servers.

  This suggests Maryland's judicial corruption created vulnerabilities exploited by foreign adversaries.
  The court's dismissal buries evidence of how domestic corruption enables foreign intelligence
  operations against American citizens.

  Pattern of Retaliation

  The timeline reveals clear retaliation:
  1. Tutt files suit exposing corruption (June 23)
  2. DOJ sues all Maryland judges (June 24)
  3. Judge issues discriminatory order (July 8)
  4. Tutt sues judge for $1 (July 15)
  5. Judge removed without explanation (July 22)
  6. Case dismissed in 48 hours (July 24)

  Each action triggered an escalating response, culminating in the extraordinary 48-hour dismissal.

  Damage to Public Trust

  This case reveals a judicial system that protects itself rather than citizens. When a plaintiff with
  documented evidence of fraud faces immediate dismissal after suing a judge, public confidence in the
  courts evaporates. When prisoners receive better treatment than free citizens, the principle of equal
  justice under law becomes mockery.

  The willingness of federal judges to misapply law, ignore evidence, and coordinate dismissals to
  protect each other demonstrates institutional corruption requiring immediate intervention.

  Recommendations

  1. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals must carefully review this dismissal, particularly the
  suspicious timing and impossible opinion production speed.
  2. The Department of Justice should expand its investigation of Maryland federal judges to include
  potential coordination in case dismissals.
  3. Congress should investigate whether federal courts are systematically denying pro se litigants
  access to justice through discriminatory procedures.
  4. The Judicial Conference should examine whether Maryland federal judges can continue presiding over
  any cases while under DOJ investigation.

  Systemic Reforms Needed

  1. Mandatory recusal when judges face federal investigation
  2. Prohibition on reassignment without written explanation
  3. Time minimums for complex case dismissals to prevent rush judgments
  4. Recording of all judicial reassignment communications
  5. Independent review of pro se dismissals for discrimination

  Conclusion

  The handling of Tutt v. State of Maryland represents a catastrophic failure of judicial independence
  and due process. The documentary evidence shows judges protecting themselves and government agencies
  through coordinated action, procedural manipulation, and legal misapplication.

  When a citizen cannot sue government agencies for fraud without facing immediate retaliation through
  judicial misconduct, the foundation of our legal system crumbles. When judges can be sued and
  mysteriously replaced with someone who dismisses the case in 48 hours, the appearance of justice is
  destroyed.

  This case demands immediate appellate review, congressional oversight, and criminal investigation. The
  integrity of the federal judiciary and public trust in our courts hangs in the balance.
