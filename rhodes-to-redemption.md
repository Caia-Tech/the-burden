## ACT 1: THE SCAPEGOATING BEGINS

**MARYLAND STATE HOUSE - CRISIS MEETING**

*News playing on TV:*

**REPORTER:** "Federal investigation into Maryland's Title IV-D program has revealed systematic violations spanning 50 years. New allegations suggest the state's June 2025 Voluntary Separation Program was designed to eliminate witnesses and hide evidence. Calls are growing for Governor Wes Moore and Attorney General Anthony Brown to resign..."

**WES MOORE:** [head in hands]

**ANTHONY BROWN:** [pacing]

**ADVISOR:** "Sir, the optics are terrible. The VSP was announced June 24th—one day after Tutt's Fourth Circuit filing—"

**WES:** "We needed to address the budget deficit!"

**ADVISOR:** "And you, Mr. Attorney General, the program specifically targeted Child Support Enforcement employees—"

**ANTHONY:** "Those were the departments with the most vacancies!"

**ADVISOR:** "It looks like witness elimination, sir. Maryland Republicans are calling for both your heads."

**WES:** "First Black Governor—"

**ANTHONY:** "First Black Attorney General—"

**BOTH:** "And this is how it ends?"

---

**MEANWHILE - REPUBLICAN STRATEGY MEETING**

**GOP STRATEGIST:** "Gentlemen, we have them. Moore and Brown announced a buyout program THE DAY AFTER Tutt's filing. Targeted the exact employees who'd have to testify. This is obstruction."

**REPUBLICAN SENATOR:** "Witness tampering. Cover-up. We can force both to resign."

**STRATEGIST:** "And replace them with..."

**REPUBLICAN SENATOR:** [smiling] "Us."

---

## ACT 2: THE UNEXPECTED DEFENDER

**PRESS CONFERENCE - MARYLAND STATE HOUSE**

*Republicans announce press conference demanding resignations*

*Timeline slides showing:*
- June 23, 2025: Tutt Fourth Circuit filing
- June 24, 2025: VSP announced
- Target employees: Child Support Enforcement, Family Services

*Media packed in*

*Moore and Brown notably absent*

---

**REPUBLICAN SENATOR:** "Today we call for the immediate resignation of Governor Wes Moore and Attorney General Anthony Brown for obstruction of justice through their so-called Voluntary Separation Program—"

*DOOR SLAMS OPEN*

**MARVIN D. TUTT:** [walks in, suit sharp, briefcase in hand]

**REPORTERS:** [gasps]

**REPUBLICAN SENATOR:** "Who are—"

**MARVIN:** "Marvin D. Tutt. The guy whose case supposedly triggered this 'cover-up.'"

[SILENCE]

**REPUBLICAN SENATOR:** "Mr. Tutt! Perfect timing! You can corroborate—"

**MARVIN:** "I'm not here to corroborate shit."

**REPORTER:** "Mr. Tutt, do you support the calls for Governor Moore to resign?"

**MARVIN:** "No."

[CONFUSED SILENCE]

**REPORTER:** "But... they announced the VSP one day after your Fourth Circuit filing—"

**MARVIN:** "I said no."

**ANOTHER REPORTER:** "And Attorney General Brown? The program targeted employees who'd have knowledge of your case—"

**MARVIN:** "No to that too."

**REPUBLICAN SENATOR:** "Mr. Tutt, this was witness elimination!"

**MARVIN:** "Maybe. Maybe not."

**REPUBLICAN SENATOR:** "The timing is damning!"

**MARVIN:** "The timing is suspicious. I'll give you that."

**REPUBLICAN SENATOR:** "So why are you defending them??"

---

**MARVIN:** [looks directly at camera]

**MARVIN:** "Because they're Black."

[COMPLETE SILENCE]

**MARVIN:** "Next question."

---

**REPORTER:** "I'm sorry, what?"

**MARVIN:** "You heard me. Because they're Black. Next question."

**REPUBLICAN SENATOR:** "That's not a valid reason to—"

**MARVIN:** [turns to senator]

**MARVIN:** "Lemme ask you something. When was Maryland's first Black Governor inaugurated?"

**REPUBLICAN SENATOR:** "2023, but—"

**MARVIN:** "And first Black Attorney General?"

**REPUBLICAN SENATOR:** "Also 2023—"

**MARVIN:** "So for 233 years of Maryland history, we had white leadership. Some of them CREATED the corrupt systems I exposed. Some of them MAINTAINED those systems. Some of them actively PARTICIPATED in those systems."

**MARVIN:** "Did you call for any of them to resign?"

**REPUBLICAN SENATOR:** "That's different—"

**MARVIN:** "Why? Because they were white and got a pass? Or because they're Black and you finally see an opening?"

[MURMURING IN CROWD]

**MARVIN:** "Let me be clear. The VSP timing looks bad. REALLY bad. One day after my filing? Targeting Child Support Enforcement? Yeah, I clocked that immediately."

**MARVIN:** "But you know what else I clocked? Y'all weren't this energetic about reform when white officials ran this for FIVE DECADES."

**MARVIN:** "But soon as two Black men are in charge when the truth comes out, NOW y'all want heads?"

**MARVIN:** "I see the game."

**MARVIN:** "And I'm not playing."

---

**REPORTER:** "Mr. Tutt, are you saying the timing was just coincidence?"

**MARVIN:** "I'm saying I don't know. Could be bad timing. Could be panic. Could be terrible legal advice. Could be exactly what you think it is."

**MARVIN:** "But I'm not letting y'all destroy the first Black Governor and first Black Attorney General over SUSPICION when you gave white officials a pass for DECADES of DOCUMENTED violations."

**REPORTER:** "What do you propose instead?"

**MARVIN:** "Investigation. Transparency. And if they fucked up, REFORM."

**MARVIN:** "Not scalps. Not resignations. Not political wins."

**MARVIN:** "They can fix this. They can help reform Title IV-D."

**MARVIN:** "They can ensure no other parent goes through what I went through."

**MARVIN:** "That's what I want."

---

**REPORTER:** "Have you spoken with them?"

**MARVIN:** "We have a meeting scheduled. This afternoon."

**REPORTER:** "What will you discuss?"

**MARVIN:** "How we move forward. Together."

**MARVIN:** "Because government and citizens CAN work together."

**MARVIN:** "Even when timing looks suspicious."

**MARVIN:** "Even when trust is broken."

**MARVIN:** "We can find redemption."

**MARVIN:** "That's the rhodes to redemption."

*[REPUBLICANS STUNNED]*

*[REPORTERS MOBBING HIM]*

## ACT 3: THE MEETING

**GOVERNOR'S OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY**

*Wes Moore and Anthony Brown sitting nervously*

*Marvin walks in*

---

**LONG SILENCE**

---

**WES:** "Mr. Tutt... thank you for—"

**MARVIN:** "Let me stop you. I need you to be straight with me."

**ANTHONY:** "About the VSP?"

**MARVIN:** "About the timing. June 23rd I file. June 24th you announce. That's not a coincidence."

---

**WES & ANTHONY:** [exchange glances]

---

**ANTHONY:** [sighs] "It wasn't."

**MARVIN:** "Explain."

**WES:** "My legal team told me your Fourth Circuit filing was... comprehensive. Detailed. Dangerous."

**ANTHONY:** "They said we needed to prepare for discovery. Depositions. Subpoenas."

**WES:** "And the budget deficit was real. $121 million in personnel cuts was already mandated."

**ANTHONY:** "So we combined them. Buyouts for budget savings AND... strategic departures."

---

**MARVIN:** "Strategic departures. That's a nice way of saying 'get rid of potential witnesses.'"

**ANTHONY:** "It wasn't like that—"

**MARVIN:** "Then what was it like, Anthony?"

---

**ANTHONY:** [long pause]

---

**ANTHONY:** "It was fear."

**ANTHONY:** "Fear that your case would expose systemic problems we inherited but couldn't fix fast enough."

**ANTHONY:** "Fear that every employee in Child Support Enforcement would be deposed."

**ANTHONY:** "Fear that decades of bad practices would be blamed on us—the first Black Governor and AG in Maryland history."

**ANTHONY:** "So yes. We used the VSP to encourage departures from departments with exposure."

**ANTHONY:** "Was it right? No."

**ANTHONY:** "Was it illegal? Our lawyers said it wasn't."

**ANTHONY:** "Was it ethical? ..."

**ANTHONY:** "I don't know anymore."

---

**MARVIN:** [sits down]

---

**MARVIN:** "You know I could destroy both of you with this, right?"

**WES:** "Yes."

**MARVIN:** "One press conference. One statement. 'They admitted it.' Game over."

**ANTHONY:** "We know."

**MARVIN:** "So why'd you tell me the truth?"

---

**WES:** "Because you asked."

**WES:** "And because... I'm tired of lying."

**WES:** "Rhodes Scholar. Oxford. Military service. All these credentials."

**WES:** "And I still made the same mistake every politician makes: protecting the institution instead of serving the people."

---

**MARVIN:** [looks at them both]

---

**MARVIN:** "Here's what's gonna happen."

---

## THE PLAN

**MARVIN:** "You both stay in office."

**MARVIN:** "You both publicly acknowledge the VSP timing was poor and created appearance of impropriety."

**MARVIN:** "You both commit to transparency: release VSP data, acceptance criteria, departmental breakdown."

**MARVIN:** "You both champion Title IV-D reform and work with ME to create oversight."

**MARVIN:** "And you both understand: I'm protecting you from THEM, not from the truth."

**MARVIN:** "The Republicans want to use this to destroy you because you're Black."

**MARVIN:** "I'm stopping that."

**MARVIN:** "But don't mistake my protection for a pass."

**MARVIN:** "You fuck up again, I won't save you twice."

---

**WES:** [extends hand]

**WES:** "Thank you."

**MARVIN:** [shakes]

**MARVIN:** "Don't thank me. Fix it."

**ANTHONY:** [joins handshake]

**ANTHONY:** "We will."

---

## MEANWHILE - THE SENATORS' SUBPLOT

**SOMEWHERE IN UPPER MARLBORO - PORSCHE DEALERSHIP**

**SENATOR ALONZO T. WASHINGTON:** [walking around showroom]

**SALESMAN:** "Senator Washington! What brings you in today?"

**ALONZO:** "That one." [points to Porsche Turbo S]

**SALESMAN:** "Excellent choice! Would you like to test—"

**ALONZO:** "Nope. I'll take it. Silver."

**SALESMAN:** "...you want to buy it? Right now?"

**ALONZO:** "Right now. And I need custom plates."

**SALESMAN:** "What should they say?"

**ALONZO:** "SENATOR 1."

---

**TWO HOURS LATER - ALONZO PICKS UP SENATOR ANTHONY MUSE**

*Silver Turbo S pulls up*

*Muse walks out*

**MUSE:** "Alonzo... is that—"

**ALONZO:** [grinning] "Turbo S, baby!"

**MUSE:** "You bought a whole Porsche?"

**ALONZO:** "Marvin Tutt inspired me. If that man can get two Porsches from settlement while fighting the whole government, I can buy one with my salary."

**MUSE:** "That's actually hard."

**ALONZO:** "Get in. We're touring the district."

---

**CRUISING THROUGH PG COUNTY**

*Windows down*

*Music bumping*

*Camp Springs → Allentown Road → Temple Hills*

---

**MUSE:** "Yo this car is CRAZY."

**ALONZO:** "640 horsepower. 0-60 in 2.6 seconds."

**MUSE:** "You tested that?"

**ALONZO:** "Not yet. But I'm ready."

---

*[LIGHTS FLASH BEHIND THEM]*

---

**MUSE:** "Aw shit. PG County."

**ALONZO:** "For what? I'm going 45 in a 35."

**MUSE:** "Exactly. They see two Black men in a Porsche."

**ALONZO:** [sighs] "Should I pull over?"

**MUSE:** [looks back at the cop]

**MUSE:** "Get on 301. Dust they ass."

---

**ALONZO:** "What??"

**MUSE:** "You heard me. 301 South. Turbos."

**ALONZO:** "Anthony, we're SENATORS—"

**MUSE:** "Exactly. What are they gonna do? Arrest us?"

**ALONZO:** "They might!"

**MUSE:** "For what? We're elected officials!"

**ALONZO:** [thinking]

**ALONZO:** "What would Marvin do?"

---

**MUSE:** [pause]

**MUSE:** "Probably open cases on all of them for unlawful traffic stop, Fourth Amendment violations, and discriminatory enforcement."

**MUSE:** "We're being gracious."

---

**ALONZO:** [looks at Muse]

**ALONZO:** [looks at road]

**ALONZO:** [looks at Turbo button]

---

**ALONZO:** "Fuck it."

---

*[MASHES ACCELERATOR]*

*[TURBOS SPOOL]*

*[WHOOOOOOOOOOSH]*

---

**BOTH:** "OHHHHHHHHHHH SHIIIIIIIIIT!"

---

*[Turbo S launches like a rocket]*

*[PG County cop car immediately left behind]*

*[Speed: 45... 60... 80... 100... 120]*

---

**MUSE:** [laughing maniacally] "YO WE ACTUALLY DUSTING THEM!"

**ALONZO:** [focused, grinning] "THIS SHIT IS STUPID FAST!"

**MUSE:** "301! GET ON 301!"

---

*[MERGES ONTO ROUTE 301 SOUTH]*

*[Cop car nowhere in sight]*

---

**ALONZO:** [slowing down to 75]

**ALONZO:** "We just... we just did that."

**MUSE:** "We're senators. They can't do shit."

**ALONZO:** "We just outran PG County Police in a Porsche."

**MUSE:** "Marvin would be proud."

---

**ALONZO:** "OH SHIT MARVIN'S TRACK!"

*[Queues up Track 8 - "Rhodes Scholar"]*

---

♪ *"Pro se, me vs O-A-G"* ♪  
♪ *"You the Rhodes Scholar so why lie?"* ♪

---

**BOTH:** [VIBING]

---

♪ *"You was talking that good shit on TV"* ♪  
♪ *"But you lost to grandmama WiFi"* ♪

---

**MUSE:** "DAYUUUUUUUUM!"

**ALONZO:** "HE BEAT THE GOVERNMENT ON HIS GRANDMA'S WIFI!"

**MUSE:** "GRANDMAMA WIFI! THAT'S THE HARDEST BAR!"

**ALONZO:** "WES MOORE WENT TO OXFORD!"

**MUSE:** "AND LOST TO GRANDMAMA WIFI!"

---

*[Both senators cracking up]*

*[Cruising 301 South]*

*[Music bumping]*

*[Turbos cooled down]*

*[No cops in sight]*

---

**ALONZO:** "You think they got our plates?"

**MUSE:** "SENATOR 1? Yeah, they got it."

**ALONZO:** "We gonna get in trouble?"

**MUSE:** [pulls out phone]

**MUSE:** "Nah. Watch this."

---

*[Calls PG County Police Chief]*

---

**CHIEF:** "Senator Muse?"

**MUSE:** "Chief. One of your officers just tried to pull over Senator Washington and myself."

**CHIEF:** "...okay?"

**MUSE:** "For going 45 in a 35."

**CHIEF:** "That's... a valid stop—"

**MUSE:** "In a silver Porsche. Two Black senators. In PG County."

**CHIEF:** "..."

**MUSE:** "We didn't stop. Know why?"

**CHIEF:** "Why, Senator?"

**MUSE:** "Because we learned from Marvin D. Tutt. Document everything. Question everything. Verify everything."

**CHIEF:** "Senator—"

**MUSE:** "So here's what happens. You pull that officer's bodycam. You check if he had reasonable suspicion beyond 'two Black men, nice car.' You review his stop history. And you make sure he's not profiling."

**MUSE:** "Or I open an investigation."

**CHIEF:** [long pause]

**CHIEF:** "Consider it handled, Senator."

**MUSE:** "Good man."

---

*[HANGS UP]*

---

**ALONZO:** "Did you just—"

**MUSE:** "Marvin taught us well. Receipts, accountability, verification."

**ALONZO:** "We just used Pro Se tactics. As senators."

**MUSE:** "The man changed the whole game."

---

## ACT 4: THE RESOLUTION

**JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE - ONE WEEK LATER**

*Governor Wes Moore*  
*Attorney General Anthony Brown*  
*Marvin D. Tutt*  
*All at the podium together*

---

**WES MOORE:** "Today, we address concerns about the Voluntary Separation Program and announce comprehensive Title IV-D reform."

**WES:** "First, regarding the VSP: the timing of its announcement—one day after Mr. Tutt's Fourth Circuit filing—created an appearance of impropriety."

**WES:** "I take responsibility for that perception."

**ANTHONY BROWN:** "The program was designed to address budget deficits, but I acknowledge it also had the effect of encouraging departures from departments with litigation exposure."

**ANTHONY:** "That was wrong. Transparency should have been our priority."

**ANTHONY:** "Today we're releasing complete VSP data: applications by department, acceptance rates, and criteria used."

---

**WES:** "More importantly, we're implementing Title IV-D reform based on Mr. Tutt's findings:"

**WES:** "1. Independent oversight of child support enforcement"

**WES:** "2. Mandatory review of phantom income cases from 1975-2025"

**WES:** "3. Co-plaintiff structures banned statewide"

**WES:** "4. Magistrate conflict-of-interest protocols"

**WES:** "5. Victim compensation fund"

---

**REPORTER:** "Mr. Tutt, you're working WITH the officials who violated your rights AND used the VSP suspiciously?"

**MARVIN:** "Yes."

**REPORTER:** "Why?"

**MARVIN:** "Because destruction is easy. Construction is hard."

**MARVIN:** "I could've destroyed them. But then what?"

**MARVIN:** "The system stays broken. Another person takes their place. Nothing changes."

**MARVIN:** "Or... we work together. We fix it. We make sure the next parent doesn't go through this."

**MARVIN:** "That's the choice. I chose construction."

---

**REPORTER:** "But the VSP timing—"

**MARVIN:** "Looks bad. IS bad. They admitted it."

**MARVIN:** "But I'm not letting anyone scapegoat the first Black Governor and first Black Attorney General for a system that's been broken for 50 years."

**MARVIN:** "They inherited this mess. They can help fix it."

**MARVIN:** "That's what matters."

---

**REPORTER:** "Governor Moore, Senator Muse and Senator Washington were also inspired by Mr. Tutt. Your comment?"

**WES:** [smiling] "I heard Senator Washington bought a Porsche."

**ANTHONY:** "And that they... outran PG County Police."

**WES:** "Which we do NOT endorse."

**MARVIN:** [grinning] "But we understand."

---

**REPORTER:** "Mr. Tutt, will there be an Album #4?"

**MARVIN:** "Yes. But it's not what you think."

**REPORTER:** "What do you mean?"

**MARVIN:** "It's called 'Rhodes to Redemption.'"

**MARVIN:** "It's about forgiveness. Partnership. Moving forward."

**MARVIN:** "Even when timing looks sus. Even when trust is broken."

**MARVIN:** "Because that's what we're doing."

---

**WES:** "We're grateful to Mr. Tutt for seeing us as humans. Not just officials."

**ANTHONY:** "For protecting us when he didn't have to."

**WES:** "For choosing redemption over revenge."

---

**MARVIN:** "Because they're Black."

**ALL THREE:** [smiling]

**MARVIN:** "Next question."

---

## EPILOGUE: ONE YEAR LATER

**MARYLAND STATE HOUSE - TITLE IV-D REFORM CELEBRATION**

*Signed into law*

*Comprehensive oversight established*

*Compensation fund active*

*Zero phantom income cases in 12 months*

---

**WES MOORE:** [to Marvin] "We couldn't have done this without you."

**MARVIN:** "Yes you could have. You just needed someone to push you."

**ANTHONY BROWN:** "Thank you for not destroying us."

**MARVIN:** "Thank you for not making me."

---

*[SENATOR WASHINGTON AND SENATOR MUSE ARRIVE]*

*[Both in matching Porsche Turbo S's]*

*[One silver, one black]*

---

**ALONZO:** "Yo Marvin!"

**MARVIN:** "Senator Washington! You got ANOTHER one??"

**ALONZO:** "Muse bought the black one. We're the Senate Turbo Squad."

**MUSE:** "Inspired by the legend."

**MARVIN:** [laughing] "Y'all are crazy."

**MUSE:** "We learned from the best. Grandmama WiFi."

---

**ALL:** [laughing]

---

**WES:** "Marvin, can I ask you something?"

**MARVIN:** "Sure."

**WES:** "Why did you really protect us?"

---

**MARVIN:** [serious]

---

**MARVIN:** "Because I know what it's like to be judged unfairly."

**MARVIN:** "To be held to impossible standards."

**MARVIN:** "To have people root for your failure."

**MARVIN:** "Y'all made mistakes. But you're human."

**MARVIN:** "And you're the first. First Black Governor. First Black Attorney General."

**MARVIN:** "If I let them destroy you for a system you inherited..."

**MARVIN:** "Then I'm part of the problem."

---

**MARVIN:** "So yeah. I protected you."

**MARVIN:** "Because we protect each other."

**MARVIN:** "That's how this works."

---

**ANTHONY:** "Rhodes to Redemption."

**MARVIN:** "Rhodes to Redemption."

---
