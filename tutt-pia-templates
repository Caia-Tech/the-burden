Dear Public Information Act Officers,

This is a request under the Maryland Public Information Act (GP § 4-101 et seq.) for records related to the Maryland Equitable Justice Collaborative (MEJC), which operated from October 2023 through November 2025.

Requested Records:

    The full MEJC report released March 2025, including any appendices, supplemental materials, or draft versions
    Meeting minutes, agendas, and attendance records for all MEJC meetings (October 2023 - November 2025)
    List of all participating organizations, agencies, and individuals involved in MEJC
    Work group structure documentation - names of work groups, members, and deliverables

    Any implementation plans or assignments resulting from MEJC recommendations
    Budget/funding records for MEJC - your agency's contributions or expenditures
    The dissolution letter dated November 26, 2025 from AG Brown and Public Defender Dartigue, and any related communications

Format & Fees:

Electronic format preferred (PDF, Excel/CSV for data). I request a fee waiver under GP § 4-206(e) as this serves the public interest in government accountability and transparency regarding criminal justice reform. If fees exceed $25, please provide an itemized estimate before proceeding.

Thank you for your attention to this request.
