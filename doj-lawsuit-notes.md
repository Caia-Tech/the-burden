  What Happened After I Filed

  On June 23, 2025, I filed my lawsuit. The next day, June 24, 2025, the DOJ sued all 15 Maryland federal judges. Suddenly, every federal judge in Maryland became a
  defendant in federal litigation.

  Judge Chuang's Conflict Timeline

  - June 24, 2025: Judge Chuang becomes federal defendant
  - July 8, 2025: Same Judge Chuang issues restrictive order in my case
  - Status: Presiding over my case WHILE defending himself in federal court

  Why This Creates Structural Problems

  When a judge is defending themselves in federal court, certain realities exist:
  - Stress from being sued affects decision-making
  - Time spent on their own defense reduces attention to cases
  - Defensive mindset toward ANY federal filing
  - Institutional pressure to protect judicial authority
  - Natural bias against those challenging government

  What Judge Chasanow Claimed

  Judge Chasanow dismissed this concern, stating: "the mere pendency of the litigation involving this court's standing order does not affect the ability of individual
   judges to continue to adjudicate other cases."

  But she never addressed:
  - The psychological impact of being sued
  - The appearance of impropriety
  - The timing of my restrictive order
  - The defensive posture it might create

  The Case Management Order's Timing

  Judge Chuang issued my restrictive case management order on July 8, 2025 - just two weeks after becoming a federal defendant. This order:
  - Applied retroactively to my June 23 filing
  - Created impossible procedural requirements
  - Prejudged my motions as "unnecessary and costly"
  - Treated me worse than prisoners (who got exemptions)

  The Human Reality

  Judges are human. When someone is being sued by the federal government, they're naturally:
  - Defensive about their authority
  - Protective of their reputation
  - Stressed about their own litigation
  - Less patient with complex filings
  - More likely to see challenges as threats

  My Specific Situation

  I filed a complex civil rights case challenging Maryland corruption. Two weeks later, a federal defendant judge:
  - Imposed extraordinary restrictions on me
  - Made it harder for me to prosecute my case
  - Created procedural barriers not in federal rules
  - Showed clear hostility to my claims

  The Appearance of Impropriety

  Even if Judge Chuang could theoretically remain neutral (doubtful), the APPEARANCE matters:
  - Public sees defendant judge restricting plaintiff
  - Defensive order issued while under federal attack
  - Timing suggests retaliation or stress response
  - Confidence in judiciary undermined

  What This Means for My Case

  Every ruling in my case is now suspect:
  - Was it based on law or defensive posture?
  - Did federal defendant stress affect decisions?
  - Would a non-defendant judge rule differently?
  - Can I get fair consideration from someone fighting their own federal case?

  The Ongoing Harm

  While judges defend themselves in federal court:
  - My garnishments continue based on phantom income
  - My motions get dismissed without real review
  - My documented violations remain unaddressed
  - My poverty deepens every week

  The Question Nobody Will Answer

  How can someone defending themselves in federal court provide the calm, neutral, patient consideration that complex civil rights cases require?

  The answer is: they can't. And I'm living proof of the harm that results.

  Note: This isn't about comparing myself to anyone. It's about the basic principle that defendant judges - stressed, defensive, and fighting their own battles - 
  cannot provide the neutral forum the Constitution guarantees. They can neither appear to be impartial. I deserve a fair trial. I filed federal papers and was immediately met with 
  every possible judge being sued by the DOJ. Unprecedented. There is no way for me to have known a DOJ lawsuit was coming.
